Exhaustion was Forrest's new normal. It wasn't that he didn't sleep, no he slept a lot. It was that his body wasn't getting the food it needed, and he was still training just as hard as normal. The best runners were light, yet strong, and Forrest was trying to meet that ideal. It was proving itself exhausting, just a couple days ago he passed out during one of his daily runs. Luckily, his sister found him a couple blocks away from their house. Letty, his sister, was bright she knew something was up but she didn't say anything. Instead, she took him home and told him she loved him no matter what. Whatever that meant.

If feeling like complete shit and his slipping grades weren't enough he was assigned a project in science where he had to extensively work with a partner. It would have been great if the partners weren't randomly assigned, but he was assigned to Kyle. Who he knew nothing about besides him being tall and awkward. Forrest was sure he hadn't said more than 5 words to the kid. Forrest six months ago would have probably been okay with it, but he didn't have the strength to be the charismatic and intelligent student he used to be.

Clearly unhappy about this whole thing Forrest made plans to meet Kyle at his place on Saturday afternoon to work on the project. At least Kyle was smart if they did well on the project he might be able to pull up his dismal C- into a B. That was a long shot though, Forrest wasn't even sure what sort of science class he was in. The normally straight-A student was set to get solid D's this semester. His parents had no idea, the teachers saw this is Senioritis, and his coach was on his ass to pull up his grades otherwise he couldn't run and wouldn't get that full ride to college that he was hunting for.

After an exhausting week, Saturday arrived. He decided to take his bike to Kyle's house to get some extra cardio in. It was only a couple miles, but by the end of it, he was feeling a bit shaky. As he rang Kyle's doorbell he stuffed a protein bar into his mouth that would serve as his lunch. He probably looked like a disaster, mouth full of protein bar, his blonde hair a mess from his helmet, gleaning with fresh sweat, and deep bags underneath his hazel eyes.

There were few things Kyle Jensen hated more than group projects at school, and the moment last Wednesday when their science teacher had announced they would be doing projects about global warming and alternative energy sources in pars he had actually had to fight tears in the middle of class. No one had noticed because no one ever paid attention to him. And not only did he have to work with someone he didn't know, which he couldn't really complain about because that was always the case, but he had to work with Forrest Graves who was popular, well liked, seemingly social and good looking.

Somehow, they had decided to come over to Kyles house to get it started. Usually Kyle would just prefer to do all of his part of the projects he had to do with others by himself, but his teachers were insisting that because he didn't engage much verbally in class, showing that he could work in group was an alternative to that, because despite his good grades he occasionally got teachers threatening him with F's if he didn't start participating in the actual classroom. He had also been told they could tell the quality difference in his work and others, so he had figured there was no choice but to let Forrest come over to work on it. At least he would be in the comfort of his own home.

Kyle hadn't been able to focus on anything at all that Saturday, he was tired because he hadn't been able to sleep the night before, he had been too busy hyperventilating into his pillow, and being tired just helped fuel his anxiety. So despite trying to watch a movie, and later on boot up his PS4, he just couldn't relax. He also spent some time trying to tidy up his room a little, but it was a constant mess and a hopeless cause, so after that he had settled for spending to much time worrying about whether or not he should wear something he'd wear at school, a sweatshirt and jeans, or something he'd wear on a normal Saturday, a sweatshirt and sweatpants. He had settled for the first option.

Eventually, though the afternoon came rolling around and he heard the doorbell from the spot he had taken in the living room couch to anxiously wait for Forrest to arrive. His heart instantly started to beat a little faster in a way that was nothing but unpleasant and his breath became a little more forced. He debated just ignoring it and pretending he forgot and that he wasn't home, His parents weren't home at that moment, so there was no one else to let him in. But he forced all his feelings down and made sure his expression was blank before he went to open the door.

He looked a little dishevelled, it wasn't hard to see, but upon a glace out the door he noticed a bike and figured that that had to be the reason. Kyle couldn't run more than five meters without looking about the same as Forrest did now. He of course didn't mention it though, in fact, for a solid moment or two he just stood there quietly before finally speaking, "Oh, uh, sorry, hey," he said awkwardly, his voice coming out quieter than what would be considered normal, he stepped back a little so Forrest could walk through the door, "Come in?" Right away he started wondering if people their age actually said things like 'come in' when saying hello to a guest, he shifted uncomfortably and decided to not say anything else to avoid sounding stupid.

When Kyle first opened the door, all he could think was how tall he was. Really fucking tall. How was he not a basketball player with that wingspan? He couldn't help but feel a bit jealous. Sure, he was the right height for the distance runner, but for any other sport, he was considered short. Despite Kyle's imposing height, he was so awkward---so much so it was making Forrest uncomfortable. He ran his hand through his messy hair trying to tame it a bit.

It was shocking how quiet someone so tall could be, Forrest found himself straining to hear him. Luckily, it was easy to figure out that Kyle wanted him to come in. Forrest stepped through the threshold of Kyle's house, his hazel eyes taking in the mysterious Kyle's home. He looked back over at Kyle, almost feeling sorry for how nervous he seemed. Sure, Forrest had been no social butterfly lately but he could turn it on when he needed to.

"Uh so, nice place," he said awkwardly trying to make some semblance of small talk. To be honest, he knew nothing about Kyle. He wasn't sure who the kid hung out with--if anyone. Normally those were so easy, but his head was starting to pound. The protein bar wasn't even close to enough to keep this shakiness away. "So, we gotta get working on this project?" he tried to look anywhere but his school project partner. God, this was going to be terrible, he couldn't even imagine focusing on this stupid project.

"Yeah," Kyle agreed simply and motioned for Forrest to follow him up the stairs to his room. He felt nervous about letting Forrest in there, and he supposed he could have had them work in the kitchen, but in case his parents came home he just preferred them not make a big deal about Kyle having someone over.

Kyle room was decent sized, not large, but not small enough to feel cramped, however, because one of his walls was shorter due to the sloping roof, making it feel a little smaller. His bed, which had its head under the part of the sloping roof and a window right by it on the normal wall, was hastily made, the dark blue duvet thrown over everything and smoothed out to at least give the illusion that things were tidy. He gestured for Forrest, who seemed tired, to sit down on it while he headed over to his desk to move things around so there'd be space for them to work. Half of his desk was occupied by a desktop computer, the other half a bunch of school supplies. Said school supplies, included books, notebooks and whatever else he was too lazy to put away between the times he used them, normally they'd just be a strewn out mess but he had organized them into piles prior to Forrest's arrival and could now easily just move them over to the small couch which was placed at the end of his bed, across from a TV with a PlayStation hooked up to it.

In continued silence, Kyle proceeded to readjust the placement of the chairs to the now empty part of his desk and grabbed his laptop from the floor where it was laying charging on top of a messy knot of chords that went to a bunch of different devices, such as his phone and Nintendo DS. He placed the laptop on the desk and then he realised he was done and had to occupy his mind and hands with something else.

He made no effort to sit yet, "So did you have any ideas about the project?" Kyle pushed up his glasses nervously on his nose, "because if you don't I think I have an idea or two, but I dunno," he shrugged and looked at a spot somewhere behind Forrest as he spoke, avoiding making eye contact because that made him uncomfortable.

The room looked like any teenaged boy's room. Hell, it even looked a bit like his own room. He settled into the bed glad he didn't have to stand any longer. He pulled out his phone to fiddle with while Kyle made space for the both of them on the desk. He quickly entered his protein bar into his calorie counter. Forrest watched him out of the corner of his eye, it was crazy how tall he was he towered over Forrest. 

Forrest noticed that Kyle made no eye contact, he was intrigued how nervous he made Kyle. He almost felt bad, it seemed painful for him to even talk to him. If he wasn't so tired, if he wasn't fighting a massive headache, if he was feeling himself, he would have laid on the kindness. That was just a memory of himself. Sacrifices had to be made, especially if he wanted to get into a D1 school. He was always 5 pounds away from his goal, he always was telling himself just 5 more pounds.

"I'm gonna level with you," Forrest said, "this project is the last thing keeping me from failing this class, and I can't fail this class. I'm busy with other things and I don't have time to think about this shit." In his mind, this was a waste of time. Saturdays were almost exclusively reserved for his long runs or cross country meets.

Kyle didn't know why but he hadn't expected those, kind of harsh, but also honest, words to come out of Forrest's mouth. It made him nervous and almost subconsciously he sneaked his hand up into his sleeve to scratch at some of the thin vertical scabs that were hidden there, in an attempt to deal with how Forrest's tone made him feel. He didn't really put enough precision into it for him to scratch anything open, except possibly on one of the additions from last night. To Forrest, it wouldn't look only look like he had scratched his arm normally, the only proof being some reddish brown under his short fingernails, which could just be dirt for all he knew.

"Look I would have gladly done all the work for you," Kyle honestly didn't care, if this guy was failing it would have probably take Kyle less time and effort to just do it all himself and then but Forrest's name on it, he was a little confused, however, because he was under the impression that this guy had at least gotten decent grades before, he was fairly certain he had seen him do a really good presentation two years ago in English, at least, "But I need to show that I can work in groups and they'll know if it's all me, and that might affect your grade too,"

As he was getting a little more warmed up to the situation, despite Forrest's negativity freaking him out a little, his voice got a little closer to what could be considered normal for a conversation like this, still not quite there, but almost. And him managing to sound a little more normal also made him a little more confident in himself, so, he sat down on one f the chairs and pulled the one next to him out, to tell Forrest to join him without actually having to use his words. Even if Forrest thought this was a waste of time, which honestly Kyle agreed with if he thought about it, the other had obviously spent time getting there already so it wasn't like he was going to leave and not even pretend to work on this.

"We'll do something on solar power," Kyle decided and turned to his laptop to boot it up so he wouldn't have to look at Forrest while speaking, "There was this part of the movie we watched in class like two weeks ago that showed the formula for the energy conversion used, it's not in the book so Mr Williams will love it,"

Kyle proceeded to speak more words in that minute than he heard out of the kid's mouth in 4 years. His voice was still a bit quiet but a bit more sure of itself. He did notice that Kyle did everything he could to not look at him. The kid was a nervous wreck, but who was he to judge.Unfortunately, it seemed like he was putting his foot down. He wasn't going to do the whole assignment for Forest and just let him put name on it. Forrest wanted to argue but he had a point, the teacher would absolutely know if Kyle did the whole thing. Forrest was actually going to have to put effort into this assignment much to his dismay.

"Yeah--that's fine better than anything I can come up with," Forrest grumbled, still not happy that he'd have to do any actual work. At least Kyle had some idea of what to do, and bonus points that it wasn't from their textbook. He moved from his spot on the bed to the chair next to Kyle. He bit the inside of his cheek, a bad habit that normally appeared when he was nervous. He let out a sigh as he watched Kyle's laptop boot up.

"I gotta be honest, I slept through that entire movie," he said with a bit of a shrug. It was true as soon as Mr. Williams dimmed the lights Forrest fell asleep. It was hard to be constantly exhausted, he pretty much slept anytime he wasn't working out. "Actually, I sleep through most of that class," he added looking a bit embarrassed. He was going to be completely useless on this project.

Part of Kyle wanted to roll his eyes or question the guy for sleeping through most of their science classes. Just the movie had been one thing, but all of the other stuff too? He refrained from saying or doing anything rude though, mostly because he just couldn't bring himself to speak about anything else than the project right now, because the project was what they were supposed to talk about and saying anything else might make him seem weird.

"I've got notes," Kyle simply, since he did have to do this project with someone he would have wished it could have been with someone who it would be easy to do it with, someone who actually had actually listened enough during class, so all of this wouldn't be new information. That way it would have been over quicker, and god, had Kyle preferred this to be over quicker.

He stood and headed over to the couch to grab the notebook he used for science and their textbook. Before heading back though, a little orange ball of fluff made its way in through the not entirely closed door and hurried over to Kyle to rub itself against his legs. It was his cat Salmon, or Sally, as he tended to call her, and Kyle couldn't help but smile a little. He picked her up and sat back down. With the cat in his lap he felt a lot better, not only did the animal always give him some comfort, but it was also something to occupy his hands and mind with instead of worrying about nothing. Salmon purred softly as he gave her some pets.

"The notes start here," Kyle doggy eared and pointed to a page in the opened notebook in front of them, it was covered in very messy handwriting that Kyle could read, but a lot of people couldn't, "Then there are the notes from the movie, and here are some of my own research on what I want us to do the project on I did that day at lunch," One of the pros of literally not having any friends at school was that it gave him a lot of free time during breaks. He had two options on what to do usually, and that was to either study and do homework or play some random phone game. He often went with the first option to free up his afternoons, "You should look through them,"

Thank God for Kyle, this kid was going to be his lifesaver. He was about to thank him when the furry orange cat made its presence known. Forrest loved animals, they made him so fucking happy. Unfortunately, he didn't have a cat or a dog since his mom was allergic, or so she claimed. He watched Kyle pick up the cat, seeming a bit more relaxed. It was amazing the power that animals had over people. Washing away worries and providing comforts that human companions just weren't capable of. Forrest couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy.

He picked up the well-loved notebook and flipped through it. The handwriting was a bit difficult to read but it was no neater than his own. "You're a lifesaver," Forrest said feeling a bit more confident the two of them would get a good grade on this project. He set the notebook back down and turned his attention to the orange cat sitting in Kyle's lap. He put out his hand and gently pet the cat on the head, a smile spreading across his face. He wasn't considering that being so close to Kyle may make him uncomfortable. 

"She's adorable," Forrest said sounding actually a bit happy, "what's her name?" Talking about Kyle's cat seemed a lot more enjoyable than talking about solar power. Cats were much cuter, much softer, and way easier to understand than weeks worth of science he had slept through.

Kyle wasn't at all surprised to see Forrest put away the notebook, what surprised him though, was the activity he chose to partake in instead, namely, petting Salmon. As he did he came a little closer, which made Kyle nervous and he couldn't help but to worry a little about dumb things like what if he accidentally touched him. So, he sat a little stiffer and refrained from petting the little creature as Forrest pet her. Sally seemed to appreciate it and rubbed her head against the stranger's hand. She was cute, Kyle loved her a lot, she never failed to be there for him when he wasn't feeling well, always someone to cuddle up with.

For a moment he wondered for a moment if he should steer the topic back to the project, remind Forrest to try to look through the notes, but he sounded a little happier and just a little more approachable the moment he had started talking about the cat. So he decided to give it a rest for a moment and just answer the question, and when he spoke he finally did it in normal speaking tone, because talking about his cat was something that made him happy and thus made it easier for him to talk.

"Salmon, cus she's orange like the meat of the fish kind of is," Kyle immediately regretted over explaining his pet's name because it made him feel a little silly, his cheeks most likely flushed a little pink, but hopefully not noticeably, he immediately added, "I dunno I was like ten when I named her, I just call her Sally most of the times, do you like cats?" that question did not make him feel less silly, but he was just a little proud of himself for making convorsation.

Forrest felt a little bad, it was clear that being so close to Kyle made him uncomfortable. He pulled his hand away from the orange cat despite his want to keep petting it. To his surprise, Kyle actually answered his question, Salamon was an adorable name for the cat. Not only did he answer his question, but he actually asked a question. It was like they were having a conversation, like normal people. The best part was it wasn't about this stupid fucking project. Still, it seemed a bit difficult for Kyle to talk by the flush spreading on his face.

"Yeah, I love cats and dogs. I can't have any because my mom is allergic. I just think she's lying because she doesn't want an animal making the house mess," Forrest said with a bit of a shrug. When he was little he dreamed of having a dog as his best friend. Someone to play with, to cuddle with, to maybe even go on runs with. Of course, those always just remained dreams. He tried for years to ask for a puppy for Christmas but a puppy never came. 

He smiled down at Salmon, wishing he had a cute little orange cat he could name after a fish. Maybe he would just steal Salamon for his own. Of course, he was just daydreaming. He'd never steal a cat. Especially because it seemed like Salamon actually made Kyle more comfortable. He may have been more of a dick than normal, but he wasn't that much of a dick.

"That's lame," Kyle decided. Between Salmon joining them, the mood being a little better and Forrest not being so close anymore Kyle was feeling significantly more confident in himself, the worrying didn't really stop, he still kept pushing up and readjusting his glasses despite them sitting perfectly on the bridge of his nose. But he was talking and that was the point, and Forrest seemed less grumpy which was nice, "When I was nine I just nagged at my parents about wanting cat until they got me one, but I guess I was kind of a spoiled brat,"

Kyle shrugged. In reality, it had probably been a combination of his parents feeling bad because they worked much, and because they felt bad about him having trouble making friends. So they had gotten him that cat he had wanted so much and he was really grateful for that. To this day because she helped a lot. She didn't make his parents be home more, which he honestly didn't mind, and she didn't make it easier for him to make friends, which Kyle always told himself he didn't mind. But she was some company and that was all he needed.

"But Salmon doesn't make the house messy at all, except when she does, which is sometimes," Kyle said, it was an attempt at saying something a little lighter and joking. He scratched his pet cat behind the ear and she yawned and curled up a little, "She's excused because she's cute,"


Jan 3, 2018#13

A small laugh escaped Forrest's lips as Kyle talked about Salmon. It was funny how quickly things could change from miserable to enjoyable with the entrance of a cat. Forrest pretty much forgot about how much his head hurt, how tired he was, and how much he just didn't want to be here. It was the first time in a couple months that he just talked to another person. His life was so focused on running and working out that he forgot what it was like to just hang out with someone else. Who would have thought it was Kyle, tall and awkward Kyle, that would remind him.

"Same, I get away with everything because I'm cute," Forrest joked. It was kind of true, he did get away with a lot because he was cute. He had it all going for him on the outside: good looks, intelligent, and a great athlete. It was the recipe for success, but even then he wasn't happy. No, he wasn't perfect enough to allow himself to be happy.

Just then his stomach rumbled, bringing him back to the harsh reality of his hunger. It was just pain, and the pain was just a mindset. He could push through it, he had to push through it. He would never get his scholarship if he gained any weight. He pretended like his body wasn't actively rebelling against him. No pain, no gain right?

Kyle had no idea what to reply to Forrest joke. Even if he was joking Kyle couldn't disagree, he was good looking, that was a fact. He would never admit it out loud, of course, so he just tried to smile in a non-awkward way that definitely was awkward.

After that he was silent again, luckily, he didn't get the opportunity to start worrying about because Forrest's stomach rumbling broke the silence.

It was the afternoon, way past lunch, but not yet closing in on time for dinner, and they weren't going to be talking about Salmon forever, they would have to study eventually, which meant at least an hour of work to make things worth it. And he was still tired from the night before, and hadn't really been able to eat much that day because of how anxious he had been, so he could use some energy.

"Hey, do you want me to go get us a snack or something? I think we've got some chips in the kitchen" He suggested carefully, because sharing a bag of chips was the kind thing he did with Amy, and thus he saw it as a sign of friendship, and no matter how much one were to twist and turn the situation, he and Forrest were not friends and Kyle did not want him to think he was sad enough to think they were friends after exchanging some words. But it didn't hurt to try to keep the friendly mood as they worked on the project, maybe it would go faster that way. "You know to keep our energy for the project," he clarified.

The internal struggle between food and mental strength battled it out. He resisted his urge to pull out his phone and look at how many calories he had left int he day. He was sure that would raise some eyebrows, even so, it wasn't like Kyle would actually say something to him. Food. Food would be good, he could spare the calories for maybe a piece of fruit or something. He would maybe hate himself late for it. But, for now, the stomach pains were too much for him to handle. 

"Uh. Yeah, maybe some fruit or something?" Forrest suggested. What sort of 18-year-old boy wants fruit over chips? Most kids his age ate like complete shit, their bodies still young enough to rebound from all that crap. He hadn't eaten any 'junk food' in months, he was pretty sure if he ate chips he'd puke them all up. He couldn't stand the thought of even eating chips. So salty, so filled with carbs, and so so bad. His stomach hurt just thinking about them, or maybe that was only eating a single protein bar all day. 

He suddenly realized how weird it was for him to suggest fruit, "uh, coach says I should try to eat a 'raw' diet--whatever that means," he laughed acting like this wasn't his idea. His coach always told the kids on his team to eat well, but he'd never go as far to suggest a diet. Most kids wouldn't dare to follow it. No, this whole mess was self-inflicted misery. But, he broke his personal record just a week ago, so the diet had to be working.

Kyle gave Forrest a slightly confused look at Forest suggesting an apple due to some diet his coach had him on. To him, it sounded weird that a coach would tell a bunch of teenage boys what to eat. But maybe that was how sports worked, he didn't know, he hadn't actually ever been on a sports team before. He got asked if he played basketball frequently, because of his height, but he would honestly rather die than play a team sport like that. He didn't comment on his choice of snacks though.

"Kay, I'll go see if we have something," he transferred Salmon from his own lap over to Forrest's without really thinking about it, because that was what he would have done if it was Amy sitting in his place. He didn't really realise he had done it though, until he was down the stairs in the kitchen rummaging through the cabinets for chips. He felt a little embarrassed and couldn't help but worry about Forrest being mad about him doing it, but he had seemed to like the cat so maybe it wasn't that big of a deal.

After finding an apple he took a moment to just recollect himself, he sat down at the kitchen table and closed his eyes and focused on breathing calmly. Things were going okay, they hadn't actually started on the project yet, but at least he had only gone to scratch at his arms once, and maybe, doing the project wouldn't be too bad.

After a minute or so Kyle got back up on his feet and headed back to his room. He placed the apple in front of Forrest before sitting down and opening the bag of chips, they were barbeque flavoured, which was his favourite.

"In my opinion, potato chips are raw, so you can take some if you want," Kyle shrugged, he was just glad Forrest had suggested he'd eat an apple at least, because Kyle would have felt weird sitting there eating a whole bag of chips by himself if Forrest didn't eat something as well.

"Anyways," he said and popped a chip in his mouth, which he chewed and swallowed, because he had some sense of manners, before continuing, "You should start looking through the notes and I'll set up documents and try to find some articles we can use as reference,"

Having the orange cat on his lap made him completely forget about the internal drama of food. Forrest ran his hand through the cat's orange fur, loving the sound of the cat's soft purrs. Man, what he would do to have a fluffy animal to love him. Maybe this project won't be too bad if he got to hang out with Salmon. He probably should have been looking through the notes, but he wanted nothing to disturb this peaceful moment.

It was a couple minutes before Kyle came back in, potato chips in one and an apple in the other. He took the apple to examine it if Kyle wasn't there he probably wouldn't have eaten it. But, it would be weird if he requested the apple and didn't even take a bite. He took a small bite before nodding in agreement. He didn't exactly want to look over the notebook, but they had to get something done. It couldn't be a complete waste of an afternoon.

Forrest placed the apple on the desk and returned to the notebook, gleaming over the pages. It was becoming quite clear that he slept through a lot more of class than he thought. Good thing he was smart, or else he would be really lost. But, he managed to understand most of the messy handwriting. For a while he sat in relative silence, petting Salmon, and reading the notes.

"Okay, so I think I get it," Forrest said relatively confidently, "so we should make some powerpoint slides or something for this? I think we have to present our findings or whatever."

As they started to work and things got quiet Kyle's mind got a little louder. He kept second guessing the silence, worrying about whether or not he should try to fill it. Was he supposed to tell Forrest when he found an article they could use? Or was he better off just letting him catch up through the notes? In the end, he kept quiet and didn't even say anything when he felt like he had gathered enough articles for them to use as outside sources, and for a while he just sat there pretending to look for things, waiting for Forrest to break the silence, because Kyle just couldn't do it.

Thankfully Forrest broke the silence once he was done reading and Kyle was glad to hear that he seemed to get it, it would make things a lot easier.

"I'm not going to present this in front of the class," Kyle said, somewhat firmly, it was technically expected for this project, but he wasn't going to do it, and he might as well inform Forrest of that now, "But yeah, we should still do a power point, then we can use pictures to explain things and it won't be super wordy,"

While he was talking he didn't really turn his face from the screen, but as he got an idea he turned and addressed Forrest properly, "Actually, If you want you could start looking for some pictures that could be useful while I look through the articles I found and compile the information relevant to this project," if Forrest really hadn't been paying attention and thought this project was a waste of time maybe easing him into it by letting him work a little on the PowerPoint first was a good idea.

Kyle's declaration of not presenting in front of the class took him by surprise. It did make sense though, Kyle seemed to have a hard time talking to a single person, he couldn't imagine him presenting in front of the whole class. Which would mean the presentation would fall mostly on Forrest's shoulders. Which was fine, Forrest was pretty decent at presentations. When Kyle suggested he look for images he nodded. "Yeah that sounds good," he said. He placed Salmon on the ground as he dug through his backpack and found his laptop. He booted it up and started to search for images, it wasn't too difficult of a task.

"So you think that Mr. Wlliams will be okay with you not presenting?" part of him was asking out of curiosity, the other part because he needed a good grade. Presenting was a big part of this assignment, and he couldn't blow it off. "I could do all the talking if you just want to stand there, I don't mind. Talking is kinda my thing," he laughed trying to lighten the mood a bit. He was hoping that he wasn't going to freak Kyle out. It seemed like social stuff was hard for him.

Kyle could only stare when Forrest came with a suggestion that was actually nice and kind of understanding. Normally when he said he wasn't doing anything he was met with sighs and groans, or just people telling him it wasn't that hard and that he should 'just do it'. Alternatively, he got the nicer version from his parents which usually sounded something like 'you have to learn to do things like that eventually Kyle'. It was really nice to have someone just suggest something simple, something that sounded a little more doable.

"I don't want to say nothing, that'd be weird," He said, his gaze still glued to Forrest, not at his eyes though, but he was looking at him as he spoke, "Maybe I can say a sentence or two, I dunno, some teachers let me have my presentations by myself after class, we can ask him if we can do that if you don't want to do all of the work,"

Kyle shrugged, he wasn't sure what he was planning on doing with this project. He supposed his inital plan was to ditch and let Forrest do the presentation by himself, but he definitely wasn't doing that now, at least not unless Forrest was okay with it, but he wasn't going to ask him to do that for him now, he felt weird doing so. He turned to his computer again, and started typing into his document quietly for a second before adding a very small, and slightly awkward, "thanks, though,"

It would be kinda weird if Forrest did all the talking, but a sentence or two could be a good compromise. Forrest shouldn't have been shocked that Kyle did his presentations after class. When he thought back on it, he didn't remember Kyle ever presenting in front of the class. It made him feel a bit bad for Kyle, to be so nervous he couldn't even talk in front of the class. It was normal to be nervous about public speaking, but this sounded like some next level shit. He wanted to ask more about it, but that would be kinda rude and probably freak Kyle out. Bringing attention to someone's awkward behavior was a dick move even for him.

"Let's aim for you doing a concluding sentence or two. I don't mind doing most of the talking, I mean I'm just looking up some pictures and putting them in the powerpoint while you're doing all the hard work," Forrest said with a bit of a laugh trying to lighten up the mood a bit. It was true, Kyle was doing all the heavy lifting. Talking was easy, compiling all the information to make actual sense was the hard part. "Hey, maybe we make a good duo. You're the smart one, and I'm just the stupid one who does all the talking," he added as he pulled a couple more pictures into the power point. 

It was kinda strange, but working on this project with Kyle wasn't near as horrible as the thought it was going to be. Maybe he was starved for socialization, he couldn't even remember the last time he 'hung out' with someone. So, hanging out with the socially awkward giant was a good distraction from the pressure and hunger of everyday life.

Kyle let out a genuine little chuckle at Forrest's little joke but didn't disagree with the idea of them working well together, not that they had gotten especially far with the project or anything, but Kyle was actually having a decent time, he would have still probably rather have done things himself, if only just to spare himself the stress he had felt about leading up to today. But now when they were sitting there and had actually gotten started with things it wasn't too bad.

"You're clearly not stupid if you could make sense of all my notes after one read through even if you slept in all on our classes," Kyle pointed out earnestly, "Plus I always got the impression that you were pretty smart,"

He was talking without looking at Forrest again, typing slowly on his laptop. He realised he basically just confessed to taking note of that at a prior point in time, but he didn't freak out too much about it inwardly, because Forrest was one of the popular kids so, of course, he took more note of him than some random kid he hadn't even bothered to learn the name of despite going to the same school for ages. The only thing Kyle really was known for was being tall and not really talking, both of which were things he didn't really like about himself.

It felt good to make Kyle laugh. Forrest couldn't help himself, deep down he was a people pleaser. He wanted, no needed people to like him. So being able to have someone laugh at one of his quips made him happy. He would still rather be working out or running, but this wasn't anywhere close to terrible. 

It was a pretty strange feeling for someone he hardly knew to call him smart. He never really had thought of himself as a 'popular kid', sure people knew his name and he hung out with a lot of the other athletes. It was just strange to realized that people knew who he was outside of his friend group. It made sense when he thought about it, he had made state Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior year.That on top of hanging with the right crowd, and being pretty talkative elevated him from no one to 'popular'.

"Eh intelligence is just a construct--right?" Forrest said with a bit of laugh, "plus my grades would say otherwise". He sighed thinking about grades soured his moods. Grades were frustrating, and they were going to get in his way of getting into a great school. Before this semester he had a 3.8 GPA in honors and AP classes. Now, he was bombing his classes and it was only a month into school. There was time to pull it up but Forrest didn't know if he had the strength.

"Nah, grades don't tell you how smart you are," Kyle insisted, despite having good grade himself. He could tell the mention of it put a bit of a damper on Forrest's mood, so apparently it was something that was bothering him, luckily they'd most likely get a good grade on this project, "My cousin Amy has so shit grades she was held back a couple of years ago, but she's involved in like three political youth movements and could debate anyone to the ground, she just doesn't test well,"

He wasn't making this up just to make Forrest feel better or anything, it was the truth, sure grades might be some testament of intelligence, but it was also based a lot on one's ability to study. Amy sometimes went on long rants about how the reason she was held back was that the school system had failed her, which in a way was true because when they looked into why she was held back they figured out she had ADD and that the way things being expected of her just wasn't how her brain worked. And Kyle didn't think Forrest seemed like he was stupid at all so he probably had a reason for his poor grades.

"And grades a really just a piece of paper, unless you're trying to get into some good college, but they usually want personal letters or stupid interviews and shit anyways," Kyle shrugged, but college applications and all that really made him nervous and he tried not to think about it, "But you'd be able to go for sport scholarships, yeah?" Kyle knew Forrest was popular and he was pretty sure that was in part due to his charisma and part due to whatever sport he was practising. Kyle actually had no idea what sport that was, sure he knew the guy was popular but since he literally didn't communicate too much about him or what his general reputation was among the students. Hell, he really didn't even know what his own reputation was, if he had one, tall, quiet and weird was mostly just his guess.

It was true, he knew deep down that grades really didn't matter. But, that's not what universities thought. Good grades meant good universities with good sports programs. He wished that he could just forget about his grades and focus on what he cared about. Yet, that was impossible, if his grades got low enough he wouldn't even be able to practice. Forrest sighed, his mood was soured and it would be hard to get him out of the funk. It was nice though---that Kyle was trying to comfort him.

"Maybe--scholarships for cross country and track and field are few and far between," Forrest said with shrug. No matter what there would always be someone better than him. He needed the triple threat to get into a good school: athletics, good grades, and charisma. Recently he'd be missing 2 out of 3. Just then his phone rang, it was odd his phone didn't ring very often. Even his parents texted him. 

Quickly he grabbed his phone realizing that it was Letty--bizarre. "Hello." pause. "No I didn't take your bike." pause. "Letty, the bike is both of ours". pause. "I'm doing a project!" long pause. "FINE! I'll be home in 20."

He turned back to Kyle looking irritated. "My sister needs the bike to get the work," Forrest said suddenly realizing how odd that sounded, "she's not allowed to drive after she ran over the neighbor's mailbox." With that, he packed up his things, gave Kyle a wave, and Salmon a pat as he showed himself out. 

The rest of the weekend was uneventful, he worked out and ran Sunday. The rest of his waking hours were spent binging Great British Baking Show(yes, he was a glutton for punishment) with Letty, and playing PUBG on his XBOX. Unfortunately, the weekend ended all too soon. Monday was a two-a-day practice, which meant it was going to be an exhausting start to his week. The only good thing was that he didn't have to drive Letty to school since she wouldn't get up that early.

Like Forrest predicted, Monday was terrible. He woke up around 5 AM with a massive headache and an empty stomach. He was off to school to arrive at practice at 6 AM, running several miles in the crisp fall morning before classes even started for the day. By 7:45 when the first bell rang he was already beat. He slept through Calculus, American Literature, AP History, and Science. His teachers woke him up several times but gave up after he fell asleep again. Lunch was painful, his headache becoming almost unbearable. So unbearable, that he got hot lunch for the first time that school year. Pizza and french fries. He only ate about half of them before he felt like vomiting. Thank God he could hold the vomit back until the end of lunch--but he forgot about the school-wide assembly right afterward lunch.

"Forrest, you coming?" Brad another kid from the cross team asked. 
"Uh--yeah save me a seat I gotta do something first," Forrest called as he made his way to the bathrooms by the auditorium. They were always really quiet and relatively unused. As soon as he made it to a stall, he jammed his finger down his throat. He didn't puke up his food often--no that would mean he had something actually wrong with him. Just, just when it made him feel ill like this.

After Forrest had left quite hastily Kyle wrapped up what he was doing on the project before moving to the bathroom to wash away whatever small amount of blood he had ended up with on his arm after scratching up that cut just when Forrest had arrived. At that point, he felt almost silly about how much he had freaked out about Forrest being, there considering how well things had gone, but he knew he'd probably freak out equally as bad the next time they were supposed to work on the project.

He spent Sunday locked up in his bedroom playing video games, because Saturday's interaction with someone he didn't know was enough to leave him drained for the next entire day. Then came Monday, and thus, school. Kyle absolutely hated school, he didn't care how good his grades were, it was still hell to be there, always pressured to talk, never fitting in anywhere. And since he didn't have any friends he had gone up to the library during lunch, as usual, to work on his homework.

Apparently, there was an assembly he hadn't been aware of scheduled right after lunch. The thing with not having any friends at school was that sometimes important info like that just didn't reach him, or well he was sure a teacher had told them about it the week before or something, but if it was at the end of class Kyle's mind was busy thinking about getting out of there as fast as possible. The way he had found out was literally through the kind older woman who worked in the library asking him if he wasn't supposed to be at the mandatory assembly that started in a minute or so.

By the time Kyle had gotten to the auditorium the doors were already closed and everyone was inside. Meaning the assembly had probably already started.

Kyle's feet were completely stuck to the ground, he couldn't move. He couldn't go inside. Not when it had already started. What if he interrupted something? What if there were no empty seats left? Or just some empty seats in the middle of the middle row? What if he did something stupid on his way in? What if the reason he didn't know about the assembly was that he actually wasn't supposed to be there at all and everyone thought he was stupid for going in there?

He knew the last one was unlikely, actually all of the what if scenarios that kept piling up in his head were quite unlikely, but he just couldn't stop himself and soon he could feel his breath getting more uneven. He tried to push it down but he just couldn't, and he knew he had to go into the auditorium, but he couldn't.

A couple of seconds later he was hurrying down the hall to find the closest set of bathrooms. As he came in he just assumed he was alone since everyone else would be at the assembly and just slid down against the wall without checking for any feet under the stall. And there he just let go and didn't try to stop himself from breathing so fast he got light headed and letting out some small dry sobs whenever there was a space between one breath and another, all while gripping his hair in such a hard grip it hurt, but which also stopped him from clawing at his arms, which he wanted to do really badly but couldn't do because he was at school.

Forrest was just then trying to center himself before he went to the assembly, trying to figure out some excuse for why he was late that would cover up his vomiting in the bathroom. Just as he was about to leave the stall he heard someone rush in. That would have been fine--it wasn't like anyone would ask him what he was doing in the bathroom. But, then the labored breathing and sobbing noises started. For an awkward moment he bit his lip, what was he suppose to do? Worse case scenario he ran out of the bathroom and pretended this whole thing never happened. Hopefully whoever it was didn't hear him puking -- that'd be horrible.

Taking a deep breath he exited the stall, at first he was planning on just acting like whoever it was didn't exist. But, when he exited he saw that it was Kyle. He froze for a second, gapping at Kyle like a fucking idiot. He couldn't just stand there and let Kyle freak out. "Holly Shit, Kyle are you okay?" he asked sounding a bit freaked out. He wasn't really great at his comforting thing, but he could try. He sat down across from him, even though the floor was probably pretty disgusting.

"I--I'm pretty shitty at talking things through but, umm I'm here if you wanna talk or like whatever," he added sounding incredibly awkward. Fuck. He was bad at these things. It reminded him of that time Letty was crying when her boyfriend broke up with her, and all he could say was 'he was ugly anyways'. It didn't help that he was dealing with his own shit right now, like just puking up the contents of his stomach and the pounding headache threating to crack open his skull.

Hearing someone exit a stall and knowing someone was in the room with him did nothing to improve the state of mind Kyle was in and he simply moved his knees, so they were pressed against his chest and hid his face in them, as if hiding would make whoever it was not able to see him hyperventilating and sobbing on the floor. But then the person spoke and Kyle realized it was Forrest. Kyle wanted to sink through the ground and disappear and never come back and for Forrest to just forget this all happened.

But at least it was someone he had spoken to before, and at least he was trying to help. Thanks to the distraction Kyle got a little pulled out of all of his thoughts, which helped him calm down a little, and soon his breathing was slower, still uneven, but he felt like he was actually getting oxygen to his brain again.

"I'm fine," He said without even moving to look up, his voice was really weak and broke a little as he spoke, a clear sign of not being fine. But he was fine, he just needed to calm down. So he tried to do that, occasionally his breath would quicken a little again but after a short while, he had most of it out of his system.

At that point, he dared to turn his gaze up to look at Forrest. He looked dishevelled again, but in a different way this time, pale and tired, but not physical exercise. The bathrooms smelled like vomit, which wasn't all that weird for a school toilet to smell, but Kyle wasn't stupid he could put two and two together, Forrest was probably the reason for the smell if he looked like that.

"Are you sick?" Kyle asked without even really thinking about it, he wasn't really good at dealing with other people's emotions, he never knew what to say and it always made him feel awkward, but he didn't overthink it because he just wanted the attention away from him.

It would be clear to anyone that Kyle was not fine. He looked like a mess, hyperventilating and his voice very weak. Forrest sat there trying not to stare at him or anything, just be a comforting force. He wasn't sure if it was helping. Especially since he felt so awful and probably looked equally awful. He was lost in his own thoughts, internally struggling how to help Kyle. If wasn't like he didn't want to help, he just didn't know how. He never had to be comforting to someone having an anxiety attack. He just remained well--there.

Forrest was caught off guard about the question, he just stared at Kyle for a moment. He must have looked worse, and smelled worse than he thought. He had to come up with something or Kyle would think he was crazy. "Uh--no," he stammered, "I--I get really bad headaches sometimes, like to the point I throw up." It was close enough to the truth to be real, but he wasn't sure that Kyle would buy it. Most of all, it made him look weak and he hated to look weak. Who was he to judge though, here was Kyle looking so vulnerable. 

"Are you okay now?" Forrest asked at first not realizing how much of a jerk he sounded, "sorry, I didn't mean it like that. Just, I'm kinda bad at this whole thing, sorry." He said looking away from Kyle a bit of an embarrassed flush spreading across his hollow cheeks.

"It's okay, I'm fine, I'm used to it," Kyle said, all short sentences as he was still trying to recollect himself from what just happened. He felt a little shitty about it, but knowing that something was up with Forrest in that moment too made him a little less embarrassed and made him feel a little better.

But he wasn't really fine though, if he was home or alone he would just spend this time after freaking out like that just crying, or doing something to get rid of the almost tingling feeling he felt in his wrist when his body was telling his that fucking it up would make him feel better. And fucking up his wrist, or thighs, or whatever. But he couldn't do that now, because he was at school, although, he'd probably ditch the rest of the day after this.

He let out a small sigh, before propping his chin up on his knees and looked over at Forrest, he really did look kind of miserable, he felt bad for him, if his headaches made him throw up it had to be really bad, "Do you need to see the nurse or something? I can't go get her for you though, I'm just... maybe she has some painkillers or something?"

It was clear to Forrest that Kyle was not fine, but he wasn't going to push him. He didn't know him well enough to feel like he could call him out. Plus, he was sure that would just make Kyle freak out again. Forrest bit his lip, trying not to think about the fact he had practice right after this. What he would do to just be able to ditch, but he knew he'd hate himself later if he ditched. When Kyle asked him if he wanted to see the nurse, a small smile formed on his lips.

"Nawh, it's just pain--it'll go away with time," it was true, the headache was now just background noise, he hated to admit it but throwing up made him feel better, "how about we get out of this smelly bathroom?". Forrest didn't want to spend any more time in this bathroom than he had to. It smelled like his own vomit and shame. Reminding him that he couldn't even indulge in some shitty hot lunch pizza without throwing up. 

He still looked a little ill, but the small smile on his lips made his face look kind instead of ill. He stood up and outstretched a hand for Kyle to take. Despite their height difference, Forrest was sure that he could lift Kyle to his feet. "What do you say?" he voice kind. In moments like these, the old Forrest flashed through. It never lasted long, the hunger consumed him quickly making him irritable and withdrawn.

Kyle hesitated for a moment, glancing carefully up at the other, he was going to get up from the bathroom floor and leave at some point obviously, but the question was if he was going to accept Forrest's hand and do it with him, or if he was going to decline, wait a minute or two until Forrest was gone and then leave.

He readjusted his glasses a little before carefully saying "kay," and grabbing Forrest hand. He let him pull him up from the ground, which wasn't too hard as Kyle obviously put some help into it himself and because he didn't weigh too much despite his height. The moment he was on his feet Kyle let go of Forrest's hand and pocketed his own in the pocket of his black jeans.

Then he wasn't sure what to do or say next really, because what did they do after they got out of the bathroom? Separate? Go with each other to the stupid assembly? Kyle shifted awkwardly, he looked over at Forrest's shoes as he spoke, "So I think I'm gonna go home or something… Are you staying in school?"


Jan 5, 2018#33

For a moment Forrest was sure that Kyle wouldn't take his hand, but when he did he gave Kyle another small smile. When Kyle asked him if he was staying in school or not he hadn't fully decided. Missing practice would piss off the coach, and he would feel pretty shit about it. But, he really didn't want to hang around school either. It wasn't like he was super excited about some dumb school assembly. He could always swing back to school and go to practice. Forrest sighed, making a decision he was sure he was going to regret.

"Nawh I'm going to go home," he said not sounding confident in his decision. Coach would have his ass tomorrow. "Ya' know, if you don't wanna be alone you could come to my place. We could work on our project or something," Forrest said regretting the words as soon as they left his mouth. He was sure that Kyle wouldn't want to come over, and he was pretty sure he just wanted to spend the rest of the afternoon in his bed miserable. But, misery did love company right?

Kyle noticed Forrest didn't seem entirely sure about going home in the middle of the school day. He didn't think too much of it, maybe he just wasn't the kind of person who skipped very often. Kyle did, he got away with it because his grades were still very good, but if anything happened like today, or if he had to hold a presentation and the teacher didn't let him have it after class, or if it was PE, he tended to skip.

His train of thought completely stopped when he realized Forrest had just asked him to come over to his place though.Kyle didn't really like being over at other people's places too much, at least not if he didn't know the person, but working on the project was actually a viable excuse for skipping, so, if he happened to be busted somehow and his parents got to know, he could just tell them that. Plus, he knew what he would do if he went home, and while hurting himself was something he really wanted to do, this could possibly make him forget about it for a while. Or make it worse, but it could be worth a shot.

"…Well, we gotta finish that project at some point, so sure, I guess," plus this also made it so Kyle didn't have to worry about how to contact Forrest to decide when they were going to work on the project next, he had left in such a hurry that Saturday that they hadn't gotten a chance to decide upon something and while Kyle hadn't really started to worry about it yet, he knew he would worry about it eventually.

"Cool, lets fucking go then," Forrest said as he headed out of the bathroom. Part of Forrest was glad that Kyle was going to come and hang out with him for the rest of the day, and part of him was regretting his decision. Forrest headed towards the side doors of the school that lead out to the parking lot. It was the easiest way to leave the school without anyone asking any questions. Forrest headed towards his beat-up blueish-green truck. The truck was old and rickety but it worked. The truck was only a two-door only able to sit three people if someone sat between the driver in the passenger up front. Forrest was sure the rust bucket was older than he was, it didn't even have a CD changer, but a cassette player. He unlocked the truck and slid in, turning the ignition. At first, he didn't think the truck would start, but it sputtered to life as he held his breath.

"This is Betty, she's a piece of shit but she gets me to point A and B," he said to Kyle as he got into the truck. For a moment Forrest fiddled with the radio, settling on a station the played top 40 hits. As soon as the other buckled up he was on the road. The truck roared down the road, rattling so loud it sounded like it was about to fall apart. Thankfully, Forrest didn't live far from the school, and soon enough he was pulling into his neighborhood. It was one of those neighborhoods that couldn't decide if it was old or new. The small brick houses were being torn down rapidly and replaced with large homes. The small houses stood next to giants, looking like David vs Goliath. 

Forrest pulled into the driveway of one of the smaller older houses in the neighborhood. Even so, it was still a beautiful home. A mix of stone and brick, with a rounded front entrance, almost looking like a turret. The front of the house was almost entirely covered by ivy, giving it an almost magical feel. Several large trees rested on the property, their leaves changing from deep green to blazing autumn colors. Forrest slid out of the truck, slinging his backpack over his shoulders as he walked up to the door. He entered the old home. The wood floors were dark and creaky, the walls were uneven plaster painted a pleasant but boring beige, and the rooms were small but numerous. 

"Welcome to mi casa, it's not much but it's home," Forrest said made his way up the creaky narrow stairs motioning for Kyle to follow. Forrest's room was the first door on the left on the landing. The room was small and cluttered. Enough room for an unmade twin sized bed, a desk with a small chair, dresser, and a tank that held a small box turtle named Dart inside it. On top of the dresser sat a decent sized flat screen tv, with an XBOX hooked up to it. The walls were covered with posters of his favorite movies, bands, and sports stars. Trophies decorated his desk, dresser, and shelves. Forrest sat on the bed using one of his many pillows as a backrest, instantly feeling better. His room was his safe place.

"Can I be honest? I really don't wanna work on that stupid fucking project," Forrest said.

Before Kyle knew it he was being led into Forrest's home, which he honestly thought looked like something you'd see as a little house in some fantasy MMORPG, he kind of loved it, just like how he kind of loved Forrest's shitty but working car, because it looked cool and he found it funny how Forrest had actually named it. The inside of the home was small and nice, at least as far as Kyle could see, seeing as he was led up to Forrest's room fairly quickly.

There he was met by another dilemma caused by his anxiety. Forrest sat down on the bed, which left Kyle just standing there not really knowing what to do or how to act. Could he sit down on the bed too, or was that weird? Was he supposed the sit on the desk chair, or wait until Forrest suggested something? It was a really dumb thing to worry about, but that was just how Kyle's brain worked.

"Oh yeah, no, I can't say I'm super pumped about doing it either," Kyle confessed, his voice was a little quiet still, but not too bad, "I'm still using it as an excuse if my parents get to know I skipped, though,"

He decided to look around to keep busy and procrastinate the seating issue. Forrest's room was just a normal teenaged boy's room, not that much unlike Kyle's, save from the trophies and sport star posters, of course, maybe a little smaller, and without an annoying sloping roof, but just ass messy and with movie posters hanging on the wall. It felt normal and that relaxed Kyle a little.

What interested him the most though, was the tank. Tanks usually meant pets. Kyle liked animals but was of the firm belief that if one were to have a pet, it should be a cat, or at least something you could cuddle with. However, most pets that lived in tanks were pretty cool, so he curiously made his way over to get a closer look.

When he saw that it was a turtle he couldn't help but let out a small chuckle. He turned towards Forrest with a small smile, worries momentarily forgotten, "Shouldn't you have a faster pet if you do track?"

Forrest tried his best not to watch Kyle look around his room he was sure that would make the tall teen nervous. Instead, he turned on the tv flipping through channels before he settled on HGTV. Yeah, Forrest couldn't help but be into all those house hunting and renovation shows, they were so interesting and the male hosts were hot. He had a thing for rugged manly men, but he also had a thing for geeky looking boys with brown glasses. Yeah--he thought Kyle was cute with his hair the color of fire, and his numerous freckles. Of course, he'd never say or do anything about it. He had plenty of guys he thought was cute, even some on his own team. He never said or did anything about it, he didn't think that Kyle would be any different

His thoughts were pulled away from how he thought Kyle was cute when he mentioned his turtle. Forrest couldn't help but laugh, having a turtle for a pet was kinda funny. "Yeah, the best part is his name is Dart," Forrest said with a laugh, "he's technically my sister's but got bored with him. I mean to be fair he is pretty boring." Even if Dart wasn't the most exciting pet he still really loved him, he'd still rather have a dog that would go on runs with him. But, that wasn't going to happen anytime soon.

"Ya' know--you can sit down on my bed. I don't bite--well on second hand I do bite but I won't bite you I promise," Forrest joked. He didn't even really understand why he was trying to be so nice to Kyle. Maybe because he wasn't fake like the rest of his friends. All his other friends were always trying to compete with each other whether it was at running or for girls or grades. Kyle, well Kyle wasn't trying to do any of that. He seemed so honest and raw. All his other friends never showed any weakness, they all were committed to the image of perfection, and lately, Forrest was feeling less than perfect.

"Oh okay, sorry," Kyle said and once again readjusted his glasses, it was a nervous habit that was so trained into his muscle memory that he'd reach out to push them up or readjust them even when he wasn't wearing them. The quick apology was also one of those things that he didn't even really think about. When he wasn't sure what t really do with himself, which was fairly often, he felt like most of the things he did was wrong and thus needed apologies.

He sat down next Forrest but made sure to keep plenty of distance between them. In part due to not being the most touchy-feely person when it came to strangers, it always made him a little nervous, but also simply because he didn't know what was too close in Forrest's book. He was one of the popular jock-y kids, Kyle highly doubted that he and his friends would sit with their legs in each other's laps and lean on each other like Kyle and his friends did when they watched TV and a movie.

He was quiet for a moment, then he let his glance actually fall on the TV, only to see the channel Forrest had deliberately switched too, "So what? Is this what you do when you're not out running laps or at school, watching home improvement shows?" Kyle asked, gently poking fun at Forrest, but clearly not actually judging him for his choice of TV, or well maybe he was judging his taste a little, not him as a person, and not too much as he supposed he could see the entertainment value in TV like this.

It was confusing to Forrest why Kyle apologized. He probably made him feel kinda uncomfortable or something, which made him feel bad. But, he did settle into the bed next to him--so that was a good sign right? A good sign of what Forrest wasn't even sure. Why did he even invite Kyle here in the first place? Because he was lonely, because he felt bad for Kyle, because he thought he was cute, or something else? Who knew maybe it was all of those things. But, whatever it was here they both were in Forrest's bed, watching HGTV and skipping school. Oddly, it was kinda nice.

Forrest cracked a smile at Kyle when he made fun of his channel of choice. It was true it was kind of an odd choice, he was sure Kyle thought he watched a lot of sports or something. Nope, it was mostly HGTV and video games. Occasionally, he and his sister would binge trashy teenage dramas together or ridiculous reality tv. It wasn't the most masculine taste in entertainment. "I love these shows! I know so much about shiplap and marble countertops, it's invigorating!" Forrest exclaimed, only faking his enthusiasm a little bit.

"So now that you know my dirty secret of watching terrible tv on my free time, what about you? What do you do in your free time?" Forrest asked. He really was interested, Kyle didn't seem to have any friends at school so that couldn't be taking up all his time. He was a bit envious of Kyle having so much free time. Forrest had to budget his hours, and more and more of those precious free hours were taken up by sleeping and running.

"I like movies?" Kyle tried to reply to the question to the best of his abilities without over thinking it, "And the non-shitty kind of TV, like TV-series with a plot and characters, you know, and I like video games a lot, and I hang out with friends when I can be bothered, the shit most people our age do,"

Kyle shrugged, "I'm honestly not all that interesting," while he certainly was telling his true opinion in saying he wasn't interesting he was downplaying how much he enjoyed the things he had listed. He really loved movies and liked to watch most of the ones he liked more than once just to jot down notes and analyse them, same with video games, and he could probably talk about his favourites non-stop.

"I'm not one of the school's star athletes with a soft spot for shiplap and marble countertops, that's interesting," Kyle joked, although he wasn't really joking. Forrest was not at all the kind of person Kyle expected, he was popular and part of a sports team, and that was the kind of person Kyle would just assume was shallow and arrogant. Clearly, he shouldn't be so quick to judge, but to be fair, the kind of clique Forrest was in was the people Kyle had gotten the most random insults and laughs behind his back from throughout the year. But Forrest being different from his expectations made Kyle curious to get to know how else he was different, so, he continued, "But running and home improvement shows can't be all there is to you? Like, what music do you listen too?"

Forrest wanted to tell Kyle that he thought he was interesting. He never could get into movies or tv shows or even video games. They always felt like a distraction from something he was supposed to be doing. But, he decided against telling Kyle he was interesting, which would have sounded like too much of a compliment. He didn't need to weird Kyle out too much. Forrest pulled his muscular legs into his chest, putting his head on top of them. It made him look really small and gave his sharp face a warmer look. Kyle was so much larger than him, having almost 10 inches on him. Forrest was normally shorter than most of his friends but not by this much.

When Kyle asked about music his eyes light up. He never went anywhere without headphones, listening to music was something he could do at the same time as working out. He was always looking for a new song to pump him up. His taste was all over the place, everything from rap and pop to bluegrass and country. 

"I love music. I listen to mostly rap and pop punk when running, just cause it has a good beat. But, I'm no strange to indie folk rock. Sometimes I like to put on Mumford and Sons and have a good cry," he was only half joking at that part, "I was also obsessed with Justin Biber--" just as he was about to go on his J-Biebs rant Letty came in through the door. They must not have heard her come home because they were so distracted by their talking.

Letty looked exactly like Forrest if he was a girl. She was lean, with an angular face, fierce eyebrows, hazel eyes, and long wild blonde hair. Her ears were pierced at least 5 times each and her nose was also pierced with a large hoop. She was clearly no jock like Forrest, rather she had a more rebellious and artistic streak. 

"Forrest! I was looking for you afte--" she stopped mid-sentence staring at Kyle and Forrest, "Forrest! Who is this strange boy you brought into our home?" she sounded mad but Forrest knew she was just being annoying. 
"Letty, that's Kyle, he goes to our school we were working on a project," Forrest said. Letty rolled her eyes knowing her brother was just making shit up.
"Yeah right, is he your boyfriend? He's cute if he is," Letty said giving her brother a knowing smile. Forrest's face turned bright red, from both anger and embarrassment. He couldn't control himself quick enough to cover up his sister's question as her just being annoying.
"No, no he's not," Forrest snapped.
"Oh shit, Forrest I'm--" Letty suddenly looked like she had just seen death, she'd pay for outing Forrest to some random kid.
"Just, fuck, leave us alone Letty," he growled. With that, Letty saw herself out feeling like utter shit.

Forrest couldn't even look at Kyle, he was so embarrassed that his sister, the only person he told he was gay just outed him to Kyle. He swallowed hard, managing to look at Kyle. "Don't tell anyone, okay?" he sounded tough but his face betrayed him. He was clearly very worried.

Kyle really enjoyed hearing Forrest hearing Forrest talk about his music because a lot of it was as he had suspected, unexpected.Sadly he was interrupted just as he got to the good part about what seemed to be him confessing to a Justin Bieber phase. It was who could only be his sister barging in and starting to talk. The stranger I the Room made Kyle sit a little stiffer and very, very, quiet.

Letty was pretty, that was undeniable, just like how Forrest was undeniably good looking as well. Only Litty's face and ears were pierced and no matter how pretty she wouldn't be belonging to the popular crowd at their school anytime soon. And on top of that, she looked like the kind of person Amy and his other friends would hang around.

Then the girl asked if Kyle was her brother's boyfriend, and the idea of Forrest being anything but straight was so ludicrous to Kyle that he would have only assumed it was her deliberately saying something unlikely to annoy Forrest, had Forrest's reaction to it not been so angry, embarrassed and defensive.

Forrest got his sister to leave as Kyle just stared at him with a dumbfounded expression, which he would have hated if someone did to him but he just couldn't stop himself, not until hear heard the worry on his face as he firmly asked him not to tell anyone.

"Who am I going to tell? The librarian?" he said in a slightly joking tone in an attempt to light up Forrest's mood a little, his expression was soft and understanding though, "I don't talk to anyone at school," that was true, even if Kyle wanted to tell someone he had no one to tell. Except for his friends who didn't even live in the same area or went to the same school as them. And if Forrest didn't want him to tell anyone he saw no reason in telling them either, it wasn't like they knew who the guy was. No, the only one he would possibly tell was his notebook that was definitely not a diary or a journal.

Kyle knew he could say something to make Forrest surer that he wouldn't tell anyone though. But Kyle wasn't sure if it was worth telling him. He liked hanging out with him, that much he was sure of, but this was the second time they properly talked so he had no idea if he could actually trust him. But when he tried to imagine what he'd feel like if the roles were reversed. If he had just been outed with the risk of the entire school knowing he'd be absolutely fucking terrified. His heart was beating fast and hard at this point but he decided to say it.

"And really, it'd be kind of hypocritical of me, I wouldn't want anyone telling people about my sexuality either," he wasn't saying it outright but the fact that he wasn't straight was pretty implied, so now they both had leverage over each other and needed to trust that the other one wouldn't tell anyone.

Even though Kyle promised him he wouldn't tell anyone, it didn't do much to help. Not really. He was still pissed at his sister and her big mouth. Plus, he wasn't even sure he was okay with it yet, let alone if other people where. Forrest sighed he muttered out a half-hearted thank you, but his mood was soured. He kinda just wanted Kyle to leave so he could be alone. It wasn't that he hated that he was gay, it just made things--complicated. He tried for years to like girls like the rest of his friends, but it was just impossible. He even dated a few, it always ended before things could get serious. 

He was so stuck in his own thoughts that he almost didn't catch what Kyle said. What did 'telling people about his sexuality' mean? Did Kyle just say he was gay? No, there was no way he could be gay. It was Forrest's turn to gape at him, unsure of what to say. Did he press him farther for more information? Or did he just leave it? The only other gay people he had talked to were online, and here was his project partner--maybe as gay as him sitting on his bed. Sure, there were gay kids at his school, but he avoided them like the plague. Being associated with the PRIDE group was basically like outing himself. Forrest was so far up his own ass that he never thought that his own classmates might be struggling with the same stuff as he was. He bit at his lip unsure of what to say.

"Okay...I mean--fuck. I didn't know you were gay," Forrest said awkwardly staring down at his feet. "Jesus. I mean, if you are gay. Fuck, sorry I'm bad at this shit. Letty only found out because she's a big fucking snoop. I just haven't even talked to someone else that was gay before---I mean I have online but not like this. Fuck, I'm making this awkward," he stumbled through his words, no longer the smooth-talking unfazed Forrest he tried to be.

"Yeah you are making it a little awkward," Kyle said honestly, he wanted to come out joking but telling Forrest that had been really hard so he was back to speaking kind of quietly again, not entirely sure how to emotionally deal with the situation. In the moment he didn't regret his decision to tell Forrest, but he knew he'd regret it later. That was for sure.

It was clear that he had been a little too vague for Forrest to really understand though, which meant Kyle was partly at fault for the awkward situation, so he had to clarify, "I'm not gay though," He corrected Forrest carefully, "I'm into girls, as well as guys,"

For some reason, it felt easier for him to say that than to straight up say 'I'm bisexual', but that was what he was. It wasn't something he was upset about but it also wasn't something he told people, he was too scared about the reactions, or about people possibly seeing him differently. His friends knew, and his friends consisted of a whopping three people. If someone asked, he'd usually tell, in a similar way as he had now.

"But the point is that you can trust me not to tell anyone," Kyle continued, "Because if it gets out through me, you can tell everyone about me and vice versa," it wasn't the most pleasant way to see the situation, the best thing would be to have someone know and you could just genuinely trust that the other person wouldn't tell. Kyle felt like Forrest wasn't the kind of person who would tell people just because he could, but it still eased Kyles mind a little to know that Forrest wouldn't tell anyone because then he'd be outed as well. Or well, Kyle probably wouldn't even do that, because he wasn't a shitty person, but Forrest couldn't know that just like how Kyle couldn't know if Forrest truly was as nice as he made it seem.

Forrest wanted to think it made more sense that Kyle was bisexual--but it actually didn't. It wasn't like sexuality had to make sense, he just assumed that everyone was straight if they weren't out. Which made him way more naive than he ever thought. Could you be good at this whole gay thing, because he really wasn't? If this was a race he'd be taking last. It made him a bit uncomfortable that they had a plan of 'mutually assured destruction'. Not that he would ever do that, it wasn't his business to tell, and he was pretty sure Kyle didn't talk to anyone at school. 

He swallowed hard, finally able to look at Kyle. It looked like it was his time to be awfully awkward. What more was there to say? He had so many questions but didn't feel like he could ask him. Forrest bit his lip, this wasn't how he imagined telling anyone. He didn't really tell him--no Letty did. He sighed, "so--how long have you known? Like that you're into both?" he asked. Was that a weird question to ask? Yeah, it probably was. But, he couldn't help but be curious about someone else's experience.

"Well... A couple of years?" Kyle said awkwardly, "My cousin's like, really gay, she used to talk about it all a whole lot, I guess I knew It was an option even when I was younger thanks to that, so I probably knew I liked guys at like thirteen? But I was still confused about it for a while, because liking both is just like… like, 'well what the fuck am I then' but after a while, I realized I was probably bi,"

After that he paused. He wasn't really looking properly at Forrest anymore, because this was a weird conversation to have with someone you didn't know very well and Kyle had pulled down the sleeves of his sweatshirt and was fidgeting a little with the hems of the shirt just to have something to distract him from his heart which hadn't really slowed down much from the anxious pace it had taken on earlier.

"So uh… um…. Have you known for long or...?" Kyle wasn't sure If it was okay to ask or if it was a touchy subject, clearly, no one knew but Letty, and he felt like he probably wasn't close enough to Forrest to talk about this. It was awkward, and he was feeling fidgety with the fear of accidentally saying something wrong. But Forrest had said he had never talked to anyone who was gay before, not in real life, so maybe this was okay.

It was strange to be talking like this with someone he hardly knew. These deep secrets coming out to a practical stranger. But it felt good to finally relate to someone on this level. Sure, the people online were nice, but they weren't really---real. There was a pang of jealousy that Kyle had someone else in his life that was gay. Someone who showed him that it was an option to be something other than straight. Sue, he had Letty to talk to about it, but she didn't get it. She was straight as an arrow. She was just excited they could check out cute guys together, which of course annoyed the shit out of Forrest. 

It was hard to pinpoint when he exactly knew, he wanted to say always but that wasn't true. Maybe when he was 12 or 13 he started to realize that he was thinking about guys the way that he was thinking about girls. "Probably since I was 12. I tried for awhile--to not be gay," he said with a shrug, "I know that sounds ridiculous like I've dated girls and stuff. It's not like I think they're gross or anything, but I'm not attracted to them at all. It just doesn't fit the image, being gay and all. I used to be a good student, and I'm still a good athlete, so I should have a good looking girlfriend. Instead, I'm checking out my teammates' asses in the locker room." God, what would the other people on the Cross team think if he was gay, he's seen them all naked more times than he could count.

Kyle almost wanted to laugh a little at the idea of Forrest checking out his teammates in the locker room, not because he thought he was dumb for doing so or anything, it was just that the idea of Forest being gay still was sinking in so him saying something that out there was kind of weird and also contrasting to the person Kyle had thought he was.

But this was who Forrest was and he was slowly accepting that. He also felt a little bad for the guy, that he felt like he had to be someone he wasn't to fit some stereotypical image of a popular kid and athlete. He glanced over at him again, carefully, still playing with his sleeves. At least when you didn't have many friends you didn't have that many expectations to live up too, no one expected him to be anything other than weird.

"I mean I find the fact that you would have to try to achieve some kind of image kind of ridiculous," Despite his nerves he managed to sound a little bitter about that, Kyle really didn't like school, and he especially didn't like their school, and frequently wished he had been allowed to go to the same school as Amy, because it was a lot better when it came to stupid social hierarchies and expectations, Amy was popular because she was very out there, whereas at their school she wouldn't be, "But I get it, our school kind of have that mentality, and It's not like I try to defy anyone's expectation either… But I dunno, it's good that you've come to terms with it? I don't think it's healthy to try to suppress it,"

His image was one of the things Forrest cared about the most. College recruiters cared about image, coaches cared about image, and his friends all cared about image. Appearing smart and social and athletic was important. Being gay just didn't fit into that pretty picture. It made things messy and unclear. It would bring up questions, like if he should be in the locker room with his peers, or if he was masculine enough. Forrest sighed, it was good to get this all off his chest with someone who understood it. 

"Yeah, it's kinda fucked isn't it?" Forrest said with a sigh, "maybe I'm just not giving people enough credit. It's not like back in the day where it was illegal or anything. I just wanna be able to do normal things like my friends, like date an shit. Fuck. I don't know why I'm telling you all of this. Just -- you're cool you know? Like you're above all this high school shit." Sure, Kyle was awkward and quiet, but he wasn't caught up in the dog eat dog world of the high school social ladder. He had no idea that Kyle actually cared way more than he could imagine.

Kyle smiled at the compliment, but the smile didn't really reach his eyes. It wasn't that he didn't talk to anyone at school because he was above it all, he didn't talk to anyone because he cared so much he couldn't. He worried, day in and day out what people thought of him, every little glance he received he overanalysed in his head. But he supposed Forrest didn't have the completely wrong idea, because while Kyle clearly did his best to not stand out he also didn't do much to try to fit in either, if he were to be able to stop his anxious worrying he wouldn't care.

"I wouldn't say I'm very cool, but I'll take it," Kyle said and shrugged, he didn't want to make a big deal out of it because he didn't want to have to explain himself, Forrest having seen him mid anxiety attack was enough, he didn't want to let him in on anything else, he didn't let anyone in on the things relating to his anxiety, "You're clearly more than the image you're trying to preserve though, just saying,"

He shrugged and gave Forrest a hasty glance before looking down on his hands, because he kind of just gave him a compliment back and that made Kyle nervous.

"And… if you wanna talk about, you know... The whole gay thing with someone you know in real life you could have my number," He wasn't sure if this was a good idea, and he felt very worried that Forrest would just laugh him in the face and tell him he was stupid for asking. He quickly added, "plus, it'd be easier for us to figure out when to do the project that way, so…"


Jan 7, 2018#51

Kyle was the last person he would have thought to talk about this sort of thing with. But, part of him was glad it was Kyle. He was quiet, nice, and didn't have anyone to blab to -- unlike Letty. Kyle offering to talk to him about this 'gay stuff' more made him a bit nervous for some reason. But, it'd be nice to talk to Kyle more about it, plus it would make communicating about the project easier. Quickly Forrest rattled off his number and then asked Kyle for his. He wasn't sure if he would use it ever but, it would be nice to have.

"I really appreciate it--you offering to talk to me," Forrest said part of him wondering why he deserved this kindness. Maybe Kyle felt just as alone as he did. They just might have displayed it in two different ways. Forrest surrounded himself with people, Kyle did the opposite. They were both isolated in their very different worlds.

Just then there was a knock on the door, Forrest didn't answer still annoyed with his sister. Letty didn't respect closed doors like she should. She didn't respect most things like she should. So, she barged in again, this time with a little less vigor than before. Over her shoulder, her Starbucks apron was draped, and her visor sat askew on her head."I need you to drive me to work," she said crossing her arms. When she did something wrong instead of saying sorry she just got a bad attitude. 

"How about a please?" Forrest said with a snarl.
"Forrest I'm going to be late if you don't drive me," she said sounding angry.
"Should have left earlier," Forrest said his eyes narrowing.
"The bike has a low tier" now she was whining. 
"Alright alright alright, just stop whining it's fucking annoying," he turned to Kyle, "sorry I gotta take Letty to work or she'll murder me in my sleep. I can drop Letty off at work then drive you home if that's okay."
"Forrest c'mon! My shift starts in 15 minutes, I'm sure he's fine with it," Letty snarled. Forrest just rolled his eyes and motioned for Kyle to follow.

The drive to Starbucks wasn't long and mostly filled with Letty humming along to the music. Forrest was seething a bit, he wanted to spend more time with Kyle alone. After he dropped Letty off, he was quiet, clearly a bit upset. Letty, when she was upset, would talk your ear off, where Forrest would just seeth in silence. The only thing to fill the void was the radio playing loudly. Forrest dropped Kyle off at his place and gave him a wave goodbye.

That night Forrest could hardly eat, which wasn't uncommon. What started as him eating healthy and watching his calories had turned into him restricting more and more. Tonight's dinner was a protein bar, a protein shake, and raw kale. All of it tasted like chalk. He went to bed with his stomach rumbling and his head spinning. He was supposed to pick up Letty, but he fell asleep well before her shift was over. Instead, she had to walk home, which would surely put her in a shitty mood for a couple days towards her brother.

The next day came quicker than Forrest ever could want, luckily he only had practice after school. School dragged, and he mostly slept through his classes. Lunch was miserable as ever, but he knew not to make the mistake of pizza ever again. Instead, it was a protein bar, some plain yogurt, and an apple. All of which he only ate half of. The practice was worse than school, way worse. Coach was pissed he skipped and was not only having him but the rest of the team run an extra mile. By the end of the miserable practice, his legs were on fire and his head was pounding straight through his skull. Of course, Coach pulled him aside and had a conversation about how he was 'concerned Forrest was having commitment issues to the team'. It didn't matter, he was still faster than anyone else on his team--by a long shot.

The rest of the week was more the same. School. Practice. Repeat. Soon enough it was Friday and Forrest was miserable. He felt bad he hadn't texted Kyle once, but every day after school he fell asleep right after dinner. His Cross Country friends asked him to some party tonight. Forrest declined, he knew sooner than later they'd just stop asking. Which he wasn't sure he minded. When he got home nobody was there, his parents were going out with work friends, and Letty was probably at one of her friends' places. The house was quiet, part of Forrest was glad, the other part reminded him how horribly lonely he was.

He pulled out his phone and sent a quick text to Kyle: Wanna come hang out? My place? He wasn't sure why he did it. Maybe because he didn't pretend like he was someone else around Kyle. Maybe because Kyle was the only person that really knew his secret. Maybe because he just needed someone else to be miserable with.

That evening Kyle really did regret telling Forest, he found that it was a lot harder for him to feel calm about it when he wasn't talking to the guy and suddenly the fact that they both had leverage over each other didn't help reassure him at all. He kept making up scenarios in his head where Forrest told people. What if he knew Kyle wouldn't tell anyone about him and that he was free to tell people? What if he made it all up so he could embarrass him? What if he told people because he knew no one would believe Kyle if he tried to tell them about Forrest?

He went to bed that night with a myriad of new red lines covering his freckly arms. They hurt a little but at least they helped distract him from the things he was worried about.

As it turned out though, Kyle's worries proved to be excessive as Forrest never told anyone and life at school was the same as always. Kyle didn't tell anyone either, he didn't even write about it in his notebook, somehow that felt like betraying Forrest. He did write that Forrest knew about him though, because he had needed to let out some feelings about it.

The rest of the day went by as it always did, Kyle didn't speak to anyone, and no one spoke to Kyle. He kept to himself, spent his lunches doing homework and skipped PE every day. Nothing out of the ordinary. The one difference to his routine though, was that he kept checking his phone from any text messages from Forrest. He didn't know why he had expected him to actually text him, and he didn't know why he had waned him too. But he was a little disappointed.

That is until that Friday. He had only been home for about an hour when his phone buzzed, when he checked and saw that it was Forrest wanting to hang out he freaked out immediately. But he pushed it down and headed out before he gave his thoughts a chance to spiral out of control. Forrest's house wasn't actually that far away, so he walked, and texted him a 'yeah sure, on my way' back, before putting his phone down in his pocket and not checking it again because he was so nervous.

He didn't pull it up again until he was there. He was standing in front of the door when he realised that knocking on it was very scary, because he didn't know who would open, it could be Letty, or one of Forrest's parents and he didn't know any of them, or hell what he had gotten the house wrong, not that he had the house was too unique, but part of him was still scared of that. So, he texted Forrest again, 'outside, let me in? :)'

Seeing Kyle text him that he was going to head over made his heart beat out of his chest. Why was he so nervous for Kyle to come over? Was it because Kyle knew his secret? Or because he did think Kyle was kinda cute--and he was bisexual so he was obtainable? Forrest shook those thoughts out of his head, he was in no place for a relationship and it wasn't like he really knew Kyle. Deep down he knew he was getting feelings for the first person he actually had a chance of dating.

When Kyle texted him that he was here Forrest quickly made his way to the front door. He didn't have enough time to think about how this might just be a big mistake. Besides being attracted to the same sex Forrest wasn't sure if they had anything else in common. What would they talk about? Forrest took a deep breath, he was here so it wasn't like he could change his mind now. Forrest opened the door, "Hey Kyle!" he said with a bright smile. "Umm my parents are out and Letty's at work so I guess we have the place to ourselves," he added. Fuck, what was he trying to say with that? Did it matter that he had the place to himself?

Forrest led Kyle up to his room, which was mostly unchanged from when Kyle was there last. He took a seat on his unmade bed and turned on his tv. "So, uh we can play video games, or watch a movie or something," Forrest said with a shrug. Jesus, without the guise of the project it seemed odd to hang out.

Kyle quietly followed Forest up the stairs, he was nervous, but hearing Forrest say they were alone was actually quite a relief because that meant he didn't have to have any awkward interactions with his parents or accidentally hear any more of Forrest's secrets through Letty. Knowing he was gay was enough, he didn't want to have to disclose any more of his own secrets just to make him feel better again.

Kyle sat down next to Forrest in the bed, forcing himself not to overthink it as he didn't want Forrest to think he was weird enough to feel the need to have Kyle be invited to sit next to him again. Despite knowing Forrest was gay now he still sat down with some distance between them, because while Forrest obviously wouldn't berate him for doing something he considered 'too gay' he still didn't want him to think that he was into him or something. They were just somewhat kind of friends or at least acquaintances who apparently were getting to a level where they maybe could maybe be friends in a while. And just because Kyle didn't make an effort in school to make friends it didn't mean he didn't want them.

"Yeah, uh, maybe we could watch a movie? That sounds good?" If they put on a movie they could always talk about what was going on, on the screen, and they could be quiet and watch the screen without things being awkward, that made things a little easier in Kyles mind. Plus Kyle really loved movies just as much as video games and genuinely wanted to know what Forrest liked to watch, so he gave him a small and slightly nervous smile and added, "What kind of movies do you like?"


Jan 8, 2018#55

Movie. A movie was a good idea. Forrest turned on his XBOX and booted up Netflix. He was unsure what to pick, something he's already seen would be a good idea so they could talk over the movie if they wanted. Forrest was flipping through the categories, picking something on Netflix was way harder than it should be. He turned his attention to Kyle, asking about movies he liked. Forrest pretty much liked everything, well besides horror, that was too scary.

"I'll watch pretty much anything besides horror movies, I'm a huge baby," Forrest said with a bit of a laugh, "I'm a complete sucker for awful action movies and rom-coms. I love comedies too--and dramas. I'm easy to please." It was true he really was easy to please with media, there wasn't much he wouldn't watch, play, or listen too. Maybe that made him kinda boring, not having a favorite genre. He just really loved movies, it wasn't his fault it was hard to pick a favorite.

"How about you, like what sorta movies do you like to watch?" Forrest asked as he scrolled through the countless options. Occasionally, he'd stop at a movie that seemed decent. He was really bad at making decisions, especially with Kyle there. What if he thought his choice was a bad one? What if he hated that movie? He never thought he'd care so much, and normally he wouldn't have.

Kyle watched curiously as Forrest flipped through the movies and listened tentatively as he described what he liked to watch. The whole rom-coms and dramas and all that wasn't as unexpected anymore, he kind of got that Forrest liked those kinds of things based on what he had confessed to liking in terms of TV the last time Kyle was there. The part about not being able to deal with horror movies amused Kyle a little though, and he almost wanted to suggest watching one just because he wanted to see Forrest's reaction. He didn't though, instead, he just answered as Forrest threw the question back at him.

"Well I really don't have a problem with horror movies, my favourite ones are the ones that are really shitty though, they are fucking hilarious," Kyle started, slowly becoming a little more relaxed and a little excited as he talked about movies, since he was very passionate about them, "But comedy is definitely my favourite genre, not the typical rom-com stuff, and not like shock value humour that's in a lot of American comedies, I mean don't get me wrong, me and my cousin love putting on rom-coms and typical Hollywood bullshit and laugh at how stupid they are so I can watch that too. But like, my favourites in terms of comedy is definitely most things made by Monty Python, and I like most of Edgar Wright's stuff, have you seen the Cornetto trilogy? They are so fucking funny? British comedies tend to be funnier to me. Not always, but they have a different approach to comedy and it's better in my opinion and… yeah... I dunno…" Kyle trailed off a little as he realised he had gotten embarrassingly talkative and probably just said the most things he had said to Forrest in one go, this was probably the closest he had gotten to the way he naturally spoke with his friends while hanging out with Forrest.

"Like I can watch a bad movie and enjoy it, as long as it isn't a boring movie, boring movies are worse than bad ones… So I can watch whatever," Kyle shrugged, cheeks a little flushed and gaze glued to his hands, but it didn't feel like the bad kind of anxious embarrassment, he didn't like any kind of embarrassment of course, and the only reason he got embarrassed over something so small was his anxiety. But the actual embarrassment wasn't too bad, he didn't feel like Forrest would think he was stupid for rambling on about it, he had asked, after all.

Hearing Kyle so excited about movies was really endearing. Kyle was passionate about something, which was amazing to hear. It was like when he used to be passionate about running. He used to be able to talk about it for hours, but once it consumed his whole life he could care less. It was still an integral part about him, but it wasn't a passion. He was too close to it to be a passion, any excitement he used to feel was gone.

"I love Monty Python, the ridiculous dry humor always gets me," Forrest said. Quickly he looked up Monty Python and The Holy Grail, and to his pleasure, it was streaming. He was quickly transported into the movie, laughing loudly at a lot of the scenes. He hadn't seen this movie in forever and forgot how much he actually liked it. It was nice to be transported away from everything for just a little bit. He looked over at Kyle and gave him a bright smile, "this was a fantastic idea by the way." 

He only hoped that Kyle felt the same way. That this was actually fun and not completely awkward like he thought it was going to be. It was nice to be completely real for someone for once. For someone to know him for him, and not the image he carefully crafted. If only he had the strength to be this real all the time.

Kyle was genuinely excited to hear that Forrest also loved Monty Python and he even picked the Holy Grail which was Kyle's favourite and never failed to have him laugh, especially not while accompanied by someone else who also was having a lot of fun watching the movie. Kyle took a very small mental note that he liked Forrest's laugh and smile but didn't think much off it because Forrest was an attractive guy, so of course, he was going to like those things about him.

"Well you were the one who invited me over," Kyle pointed out, then he felt a little awkward because the way he phrased it, it made it sound kind of like he was the fantastic idea, which he obviously wasn't, "But yeah, watching movies tends to be fantastic,"

Situation saved, although Kyle doubted Forrest even thought about the way he had phrased things, because it was probably one of those things Kyle got worked up over nothing over. So he let it go, which was surprisingly easy. Forrest was nice and they were watching a movie Kyle really loved, he was feeling relaxed and happy and couldn't really be bothered to worry too much. It was nice.

"I don't know if you can tell, but I'm kind of a huge movie buff," he said with a small chuckle and gave Forrest a grin alongside it.

It was pretty cool that Kyle was so into movies like actually to be knowledgeable about them. Forrest still got Ryan Reynolds and Ryan Gosling confused, all he knew was that they were both cute. It was nice that watching a movie seemed to make Kyle more relaxed, he was always so nervous that it was good to see a new side of him. A side of him that he really liked. God, he was so cute when he was smiling. Jesus, what was wrong with him? He barely knew Kyle, but he really wanted to kiss him in that moment. It was a mixture of his teenage hormones and never kissing anyone who he actually had been interested in. He tried to push his feelings down inside him as much as possible.

"It's cool you're so into movies," Forrest said as he scooted a bit closer to Kyle. He tried to play it off like he was just adjusting his position to be more comfortable. He even was trying to convince himself that. He was only moving closer to be more comfortable, but deep down he knew it was because he wanted to be close to Kyle. They were so close that Forrest's legs were just barely touching Kyle's. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What was he doing?

"You know, you should smile more often," Forrest said his face flushing bright, "I mean--fuck. Sorry, that sounded weird." He looked away trying to hide the red that was spread across his cheeks.

Kyle's freckly cheeks probably flushed bright red when Forrest told him to smile more. Because that was a compliment to his appearance and that was so weird to hear from someone like Forrest. But he had quickly corrected himself so it clearly didn't mean anything weird, it just sounded a little weird. So, Kyle did his best to calm down a little, which hopefully made his cheeks go back to something more like their normal pale colour.

He shifted a little awkwardly and looked down at his legs, suddenly he was very aware of the fact that Forrest's legs were touching his. He didn't really mind him touching him at this point but he sat just a little stiffer, afraid that Forrest would realise and think it was weird.

"Don't worry," Kyle said a little awkwardly because he really wasn't sure, "I have a friend who says shit like that every once in a while," he shrugged, "So maybe you're right," he gave him a shy smile as if to confirm. He was just being friendly and nice and Kyle was trying his best to act accordingly.

"I'd tell you to do it too but I feel like you smile more than me, so it'd be hypocritical, but the point is that your smile is nice, I guess,"

Making Kyle blush gave Forrest some sort of sick enjoyment. Not that he wanted to make him nervous or anything. Or maybe he did, he had no fucking clue what he was doing. It was Forrest's turn to blush, the red spreading down to his neck. Kyle thought his smile was nice, his heart started to flutter. Why was he so nervous? He didn't mean anything by it, and even if he wanted to kiss those lips with that nice smile it didn't mean Kyle wanted to. He wished the bright blush that spread across his face didn't give his emotions away so readily. He bit his lip nervously, wondering if Kyle realized he was acting weird. Was he acting weird? Fuck. 

"Thanks," he said a bit more quiet than usual. He just didn't want to act like a complete fool, but he was internally slobbering all over the first queer guy he knew. Did Kyle know he was thinking about kissing him? Of course, he didn't, but he thought that maybe he did. Forrest shifted a bit clearly a bit unsure. With girls he had dated it was easy, he just went through the motions like a robot. But with Kyle, it was a different story. He took a deep breath wanting to return his attention back to the movie but his brain kept on going back to Kyle. 

"I'm sorry I didn't text you this week," Forrest said trying to talk about something other than how much he liked Kyle's smile, "I just was really busy and---I like talking to you." Forrest sighed why was he so impossibly weird? What was he even trying to say?

Kyle stared as Forrest's face turned red as well, he didn't comment on it of course because he didn't like it when people commented on his own blushing. But he did notice that his cheeks being flushed didn't really do anything to make him less good looking.

"It's fine, I get it, you have a busier schedule than me," Kyle reasoned, "Like, I don't have practice or a bunch of friends or whatever," He didn't care that it had taken Forrest a while to text him, Kyle hadn't even texted him at all after all. He had been too nervous.

"But I.. Well, it's fun hanging out with you... I like talking to you too?" He wasn't able to phrase it confidently because he felt a little weird saying it, but it was true. Kyle didn't have many friends, the ones he did have didn't live close by so most of his free time was spent alone, with Sally of course. He didn't mind being alone though, but he didn't like being lonely, and hanging out with Forrest like this, actually just waiting to see if he would text him, made him feel less lonely "So, I'm glad you did invite me,"

He was glad that Kyle was glad that he invited him. He was also glad that Kyle was having fun hanging out with him. Maybe, maybe he would be happy if he kissed him. Jesus, he just needed to do it or not do it. He moved in a bit closer, this time the shift was a little less unintentional seeming. His whole side of his body was touching Kyle's. Fuck this was dumb, this was really dumb. Kyle was going to hate this--why did he think that Kyle would like him. At the same time, the other part of his mind was also saying the opposite, that he should do it, that Kyle must have been attracted to him. Fuck it. He was going to do it.

Forrest lifted a shaking hand and pressed it to Kyle's cheek, in a quick movement his lips were on Kyle's. It felt so right but so wrong at the same time. It was a short kiss, but it was enough to make Forrest's cheeks flare up. He pulled away from Kyle as quickly as the kiss started. He hated that he just did that. He looked away from Kyle his body still touching the others. "I'm--I'm sorry," Forrest whispered, "I shouldn't have done that." Why? Why was he so greedy? He couldn't stop at having Kyle as a kinda-sorta friend, but he had to kiss him.

The kiss happened to fast for Kyle to be able to avoid it. One second Forrest's hand was on his cheek, the next their lips were pressed together and the next he had pulled back. Kyle really wished he hadn't done that. Not because it was a kiss but because he hadn't expected it and he was fairly certain that it wasn't what he actually wanted.

And now Forrest was just sitting there, apologizing, looking guilty, still very close.

He was to close, it made it hard to breathe. Kyle scooted a little to the side o that Forrest no longer was touching him. He couldn't really move more at that moment. Part of him wanted to stand up and just leave, because he could feel the anxiety starting to wrap itself around him in a grip he would be able to get out of. Another part of him was frozen, stuck to the bed, scared of what would happen if he did move. Maybe Forrest wouldn't want to be friends anymore, maybe things

"That's not—" Kyle's voice broke so he tried again, "Why would you do that? I said you could talk to me, not… Not that? It's different. Why—?"

He fucked it all up, he made Kyle upset all because he was thinking with his dumb teenage boy brain. Kyle was the only person he could talk to about being gay, and he ruined it. He scooted away from Kyle giving him space. Why was he so dumb. He couldn't even give the question Kyle was asking a good answer. Why? Why did he do it? Because he wanted to. Because he was selfish and dumb and terrible. He looked away from Kyle, unable to look at the havoc he caused.

"I'm--I'm sorry," he already said that and that wasn't an answer. He swallowed hard trying to think of a good reason, but there wasn't any. "I just. I just got carried away, I think you're cute and I just---" it was a terrible reason. Forrest was so used to just being able to take whatever he wanted. But, Kyle was a person, a nice fucking person. He couldn't just kiss him like that. He felt so bad he wanted to cry, but he couldn't let Kyle see that. "I'm sorry," he said again because he didn't know what else to say.

Forrest was apologizing but he wasn't giving any other reasons than getting carried away and thinking Kyle was cute, but that wasn't answers that calmed him down because they didn't really mean anything. Kyle still didn't know if Forrest had just done that just because he could, just to try kissing another guy, or if he did it because he actually felt something for Kyle.

"It's okay it's just… I—I don't really know you, and I uh, I don't like you that way, or want to do anything like that with you even if you don't like me and just want to kiss or whatever?" He still sat completely Frozen, looking more at Forrest's legs than anything else because he couldn't even muster up the courage to look at his face. He was trying so hard to push his emotions down but tears were still forming in his eyes, not because he was sad or couldn't take someone kissing him, he had kissed people before, it was just that all the anxiety he was trying not to feel had to surface somehow.

"I'm sorry," Kyle added, despite having done nothing wrong and knowing he had done nothing wrong. There was just this part of him that didn't want to upset Forrest for some reason, and he just kind of wanted to be his friend, and he was afraid that even if that kiss hadn't ruined anything, that something he said was going to ruin it.

He'd be lying if it didn't hurt Forrest when Kyle said he didn't like him like that. Not that Forrest was even sure if he liked Kyle like that. They hardly knew each other, but it still felt like a blow to his confidence. Forrest tried to look at Kyle but the other just looked so miserable. Like he was about to cry. He was no better than the assholes at his school who bullied the 'weird' kids. Forrest thought his status was enough for Kyle to want him back. He thought that Kyle would be like any of the girls who fell all over him. No, Kyle wasn't like that, and that's what Forrest liked about him.

He couldn't believe that he caused this, that he hurt Kyle this way. We wanted to scream into his pillow and let out all his frustration towards himself. What was worse was hearing Kyle say sorry--he had nothing to say sorry for. Forrest should be the one begging for forgiveness. He hated that he made Kyle feel like he had to apologize. Why was he such a fuck up?

"Don't apologize," Forrest said trying to sound a bit less miserable with himself, "you have nothing to be sorry for." He shook his head forcing himself to look at Kyle. "I--I get it if you hate me, and if you wanna go home I can take you home," Forrest said his voice sounding sadder than he intended. He wanted to explain himself more, but he really couldn't. There was no explanation for his behavior. He ruined whatever they had.

"I don't hate you," Kyle assured Forrest, and it was true, if he hated anyone it was himself for overreacting so bad. It was just a kiss, Forrest was just curious, yet Kyle couldn't stop himself from freaking out, "Things like this just makes me really nervous," that was the understatement of the century, Kyle barely knew what to do with himself because he was so nervous, "and you couldn't know that,"

He really did wish this hadn't happened, but at the same time, he really didn't blame Forrest, especially since he regretted it. Kyle just wasn't very good at showing that he was okay with it in that moment, because, as he had said, he was really nervous.

"But y-yeah, I—I think I'm gonna go home," He wasn't sure for how much time he could hold himself together, his breathing was becoming more forced and uneven and all he knew was that he really needed to go home and lock himself in his room and not talk to anyone until he got the anxiety out of his system.

But he was still at Forrest's and that was a problem, he finally moved out of the bed, carefully climbing out and standing on shaky legs, he still didn't really look at forest as he said, "You don't need to take me though, I'll walk" in a really quiet voice, suddenly all the comfort and confidence he had felt around Forrest was gone.

"Okay--I'll show you out," he said meekly. Well. He really, really, really fucked this up. Forrest slid off his bed and lead Kyle down the stairs and to the door. As Kyle left he waved goodbye, still feeling especially horrible. He went back up to his room, where he hid underneath his covers and listened to the saddest music there ever was. He resisted texting Kyle to say he was sorry again. He was sure that it would do nothing to help. He was just saying sorry at this point to make himself feel better. It wasn't long before Letty was home and was calling Forrest's name. She probably had some juicy gossip to spill or wanted to bitch at him about work.

She barged into his room in typical Letty fashion, she grumbled about Forrest hiding under this covers. Even though that was the universal sign of 'don't fuck with me,' Letty sat on the bed next to her brother. Her wild hazel eyes a bit softer than normal. "Forrest, what's up?" she asked ruffling her brother's hair a bit. Forrest just grumbled press his face into his pillow. 

"Did Kyle break up with you?" she joked trying to lighten the mood. 
"No," Forrest said sounding annoyed.
"Did you find out that Justin Beiber is straight?"
"No Letty, just fuck off an go away okay?"
"Ya' know bro, I'm an expert on boys. You ever wanna talk about it I'm here," she said as she left the room. Forrest just groaned again, wishing he was dead or just wasn't such an ass. His first kiss with a guy and he fucked it all up.

Kyle was led out of the house and then left to walk home by himself, he made it about halfway before he couldn't keep from crying. Luckily the streets were empty, and he was not disturbed on his way home to lay under his blankets and let the anxiety take over.

The next week was really weird. Nothing out of the ordinary happened at school but he and Forrest met to work on the project twice before it was completely done. During that time Kyle didn't talk much, he wasn't anxiety-ridden as he had been right after it had happened, and he was sure he could talk to Forrest about things like they had been able to do before, he just hadn't known what to say. He tried to give him the occasional smiles, though, just to show him that he wasn't mad or anything.

Of course, the project being done meant the presentation was coming closer, they had still decided that Kyle wasn't going to say more than three sentences, one at the start (but not the first line), one in the middle and one in the end, that way he was technically partaking in the entire presentation. But it didn't matter how little he had to say, he would still have to stand in front of everyone and say it and Kyle found that absolutely horrifying.

The days leading up to the presentation Kyle could barely sleep as he spent all time he wasn't distracted feeling anxious by the impending presentation. Plenty of new cuts were added to his arms and thighs during this time in an attempt to make him feel better, it only helped momentarily though so it was pretty useless.

When the day came to hold the presentation Kyle just pushed it out of his head completely until it was time for science, about half an hour before class the worrying started, and he had never wished more that things weren't awkward between him and Forrest because having someone to talk to, just about random things, would have made him feel better.

Kyle got to the classroom with plenty of time to spare so he could get a seat in the far back, he always sat there because sitting in the front of the room made him nervous. And as he sat there, tapping his foot rapidly on the ground, he stared at the door, watching as the rest of his classmates slowly started to drop in after lunch, waiting for Forrest to come in through the door so they could double check they had everything before class.

If it wasn't for the strangeness between him and Kyle the week would have been pretty normal: practice was intense, but a welcome distraction and school was boring and most of it was spent sleeping. Forrest had a few meetings with Kyle about their project, they were purely about the project. Not a word was mentioned about him kissing Kyle. Forrest wasn't sure if he was grateful or not. It wasn't long before the day of the presentation. Forrest normally wouldn't have been nervous, but Kyle's anxiety wore off on him.

The agreement was that Forrest would do almost all the talking, with Kyle having a few sentences. The words were even written on the power point, so all he had to do was read off of them. Even so, he knew that Kyle was nervous. His anxiety when talking about the presentation was palatable. Forrest walked into the classroom a few minutes before the bell. He found a seat near Kyle at the back. 

"Hey," he said as he slid into his seat, "we got this okay?" Forrest tried to give him an encouraging smile. He hoped he didn't come out as forced as it seemed. He was hopeful that this would go fine. That it would pull up his dismal grade. The only thing that sucked was now that it was over, Kyle didn't have a reason to talk to Forrest. Would they even acknowledge each other's existence any more? He didn't have long to ponder that as their teacher began class.

He announced the order that the groups were going, they were going right in the middle. That was perfect, everybody would just forget about their presentation by the end of class. Hopefully. The three other presentations ahead of them went quickly. Which was both a blessing and a curse. Forrest nodded to Kyle trying to be encouraging as they headed to the front of the class. It only took him a minute of fiddling with the computer to get their slides up.

"Hi guys!" Forrest said sounding fakely cheerful, "I'm Forrest and this is Kyle. Today our presentation is on solar energy. We're going to talk about the technology, the benefits, and the drawbacks of this type of clean energy." Forrest droned on hitting his stride and speaking with clear confidence. Forrest flipped to the slide that Kyle was supposed to read, he looked over at his partner giving him an encouraging smile.

Kyle really appreciated Forrest's encouraging smile before they started it was nice to have someone who seemed to understand how nervous he was about this, maybe not on a personal level, but enough to be able to realise that he needed the slight support he was giving him.

While they waited for their turn Kyle's worry grew and grew, and by the time they were standing in front of the class he was so nervous, he felt sick. Throughout the years he had been forced to hold his presentations in front of the class, generally with threats of failing him if he didn't, but it had probably been over a year since the last time and he honestly wasn't sure if he'd actually be able to speak

He had made keycards, mostly to have something to do with his hands while they were standing there, and said keycards included what Forrest was saying in case he missed something important, but in holding them he could see that his hands were actually trembling slightly and that made him worry about other people seeing that.

Forrest said his first line and then all of a sudden it was Kyle's turn. At first, he just stood quietly, swallowing hard and pushing his glasses up with a trembling hand. But then he spoke. Stuttering and in a very quiet voice Kyle spoke, he managed to say his entire line, eyes glued on his keycards without actually seeing them, to the rest of the class it would look like he was struggling to remember that single line but he was actually just struggling to formulate the words.

When he was done he didn't look up and just waited for Forrest to take over, while waiting to say his second line, he wasn't calmer now that he had said it, simply because it hadn't really gone well when he said that first one, he had been embarrassingly nervous, and it had showed.

It was hard to listen to Kyle stumble through his sentence. He wanted so bad to jump in and help him out. Instead, he had to watch him drown. Kyle's fumble took some of the wind out of his sails. He sounded less enthusiastic as we went through the middle half of the presentation. It was hard to rally when all he could think about was how Kyle would handle his next line. Forrest flipped to the slide that Kyle was supposed to handle feeling himself become nervous. He could just do the rest of the presentation, but he wanted to give Kyle another chance.

Nervously, he looked over at Kyle. The poor kid looked like he was about to get sick. He wanted to reach out and tell him it was okay. That nobody really gave a shit or was paying attention. But that wasn't true anymore. Fumbling over his words like that brought more attention than just standing up there would have. He wanted to save Kyle from downing under his own anxiety but he had no idea how to help.

Forrest did his next couple of lines without any difficulty it seemed, at least in Kyles opinion and all while he talked Kyle tried to mentally prepare himself to do his own next line better. He didn't do it much better, though, still quiet and stumbling over his words. When he was done he dared to look up for a second, only to see people exchanging some confused glances at the fact that handing over the ward back to Forrest so quickly. Kyle went back to staring at his key cards, regretting looking at anything else at all.

Once Forrest had gotten through the next part it was finally time for Kyle's last line and while he just wanted it over he had to take a moment to take a somewhat deep breath before talking. Once again his voice was quiet, but this time when he stuttered he really messed up a word, so he said it again t correct himself, paused, and then said it again to continue. He only had a couple of words left when he heard it. Someone snickering in the row of classmates in front of him.

"And that's…. That's…" Kyle desperately tried to figure out what he was trying to say, tried to remember the lines he had learnt by heart for this, but nothing. His mind was completely blank in terms of the presentation, to full of other thoughts.

They are laughing at me. What was I supposed to say next? I said that word like three times, they must think I'm stupid. I can't find it on the key cards either. Why can't I remember? What was I supposed to say?

All while the thoughts kept whirling around he just stood there, completely frozen, staring down at his key cards, heart beating fast, it was too much going on at once so he just couldn't do anything.

The ship was sinking, some asshole kid laughed and it sent Kyle spiraling. Who even knew if his classmate was laughing at Kyle or something he found entertaining on his phone. It didn't matter though, there was no way Kyle was going to get through this line. No fucking way. Forrest was going to have to step in and help Kyle. Clearing his own throat he tried to bail water out of this sinking ship. 

"And that's a wrap. Thank you for listening to your presentation on solar power," Forrest said. That wasn't actually supposed to be the end of their presentation, but he wasn't sure if Kyle could handle standing there any longer. Hopefully, their teacher would be understanding in grading. Hopefully, they would see how much effort Kyle and Forrest actually put into the presentation. They had a lot of information on their slides and they also turned in their notes. Maybe, just maybe that would make up for their terrible presentation. Part of Forrest couldn't help but be annoyed with Kyle. All he had to do was say 3 sentences, and he couldn't even do that. But, he knew it wasn't fair--clearly, something bigger was going on.

"Thank you, Kyle and Forrest, for that interesting presentation on solar power. Amy and Mike, you're up next," Mr. Williams said as Forrest made his way back to the seat. Forrest settled into his seat pulling out his phone underneath his desk so Mr. Williams wouldn't see him text.

You okay? he sent to Kyle. It was probably a dumb question.

Kyle didn't have to stand there quietly for much longer because Forrest swooped in and wrapped things up, and then just like that, Kyle was back in his seat, finally able to calm down a little, but he was still rubbing his eyes every two minutes because they were a little wet. He jumped a little when he felt his phone vibrate, but still took it out of his pocket a second later and found that it was from Forrest. He glanced over at him a little confused before opening. He was asking if he was okay, and that actually made him feel more okay.

Yeah. He pressed send, paused for a moment, looked over at Forrest, who had been so fucking nice and saved him. He started typing again, quickly, and then pressed send, I'm sorry I fucked it up, I know you really needed this for your grade, I'll talk to Mr W. and tell him it was my fault we had to cut it short, it's not fair that your grades might be affected by my stage fright or w/e, you worked hard on this.

It was easier to communicate in text for Kyle, there was no need for verbalizing his words, and he had time to think through the sentences before he pressed send and go back and change stuff that sounded stupid, plus you didn't actually have to look at the person you were talking it. He had turned his gaze from Forest now, pretending to Listen to Amy and Whatever-his-name-was' presentation, but keeping his phone in his hand in his lap.

Kyle texted him back more words than he was expecting. It was the most words Kyle said to him since that fateful night when Forrest kissed him. Forrest read through the text, feeling bad that he was kinda mad at Kyle for fucking up. Clearly, he felt bad, and he was starting to think that it wasn't his fault he couldn't speak in public. Forrest bit his lip, wishing he could actually tell Kyle it was okay. Things didn't always seem as genuine through text. Quickly he texted, it's chill, you did your best. It wasn't long before Amy and Mitch or Matt or whatever his name was finished their presentation. Mr. Williams spoke for a bit about something--Forrest wasn't really paying attention, and then the bell rang.

The classroom was suddenly loud, students gathering all of their things and throwing them into their bags. Forrest turned to Kyle, "you sure you're okay?" he asked he sounded concerned. He couldn't help but remember Kyle freaking out in the bathroom just a week ago. He really didn't want Kyle to be upset like that. "I can go talk to Mr. Williams with you?" Forrest added thinking that maybe would help.

"I'm fine, and that'd be nice, thank you," Kyle said quietly and gave Forrest a smile. He felt really bad for not having been able to pull himself together to do the presentation properly for Forrest's sake, especially now that he was being so nice and patient with him.

They waited until the classroom was empty, save for Mr Williams who was sorting through some papers by his desk. Kyle stood and waited for Forrest to walk with him before heading over to their teacher. And even that was hard, getting over there and getting his attention. Kyle really wished things didn't have to be so hard all the time, that he could just function like a normal person, but he just couldn't no matter how hard he tried, today was proof of that. He had really tried to do his best with the presentation, but he just hadn't been able to do it.

Forrest being there next to him actually made it a lot easier though, things were always easier with a friend around. He wasn't sure if Forrest was really his friend or not, but he was someone he knew, at least, and that was truly something.

"I um, Mr Williams?" he asked and once the teacher had moved their attention up too him, most people had to look up at him when he talked, Kyle hated it, he continued, "There was more to our presentation, I just forgot what to say and Forrest didn't want me to get too nervous about it and we stopped it,"

Kyle's voice was weak and the tears behind it were apparent. He sniffled a little and whipped his eyes, because it was hard to hold it all back when he was talking. This wasn't even the first time he cried in front of a teacher because of a presentation though, and while that was embarrassing it actually prevented Kyle from freaking out about it, "So it shouldn't affect his grade, because it was my fault and he's been working really hard on this, and he did a lot of the text too, and if it'll affect his grade we can do it again, but I really don't want to do it again, the rest is in our notes anyways,"

Was Kyle really about to cry? Forrest knew he was upset but he didn't know he was that upset. Forrest wanted to reach out and comfort him. Instead, he just stood there looking like a complete idiot. Forrest was unsure what to do or say. He only ever had to deal with Letty crying. Which normally he'd just tell a dumb joke, or threaten to beat up whoever made her cry. With Kyle, he couldn't do any of that. He shifted nervously, clearly uncomfortable with all of this.

Mr. Williams looked between Forrest and Kyle. It was frustrating to have someone like Forrest ask anything from him. The kid slept during all his classes and part of him doubted he worked hard at all. It was more likely he used Kyle and let him do all the work. Of course, he wouldn't say that.

"Boys, the presentation was part of the grade," Mr. Willams spoke firmly, "but, I will consider the notes and slides heavily in my grading. Now, you guys better hurry to your next class the bell is about to ring." 

"Thanks, Mr. Willaims" Forrest said as he shouldered his backpack and started out of the classroom.
"And Forrest, try to get more sleep at home."

Forrest rolled his eyes and stepped out of the science classroom. He looked over at Kyle, who he was sure felt horrible. He wished there was something he could do. But, he'd probably just make it worse. "I gotta go to lunch," Forrest said awkward, "but if you wanna talk to me you can just text me, okay?"

"Yeah okay," Kyle said quietly, he wasn't sure if he would, simply because he wasn't sure if Forrest really wanted him to do that or if he just was saying that to be nice. He was just about to let him leave, when he decided that he didn't want this whole thing to end like this though, because he felt that if he didn't do something, they wouldn't talk again, because they no longer had the project as an excuse.

"Forrest, hang on, I…" Kyle looked around the corridor and noted that no one was there, so he continued, still in a quiet voice, both because he still was shaken after the presentation and because he didn't want people to hear him ask, "Are we friends?"

His face heated up almost immediately after saying that because it was such a dumb and embarrassing thing to have to ask, but he just… He wanted to be friends with Forrest, actually having someone there when he went to talk to Mr Williams a moment ago had been nice, and he didn't have anyone else in school, so knowing that there was at least someone who was his friend would be nice.

"I mean… I—I don't care about… you know," he said referring to the kiss, without referring to it because he didn't want anyone accidentally walking past and hearing, "And it's been nice working on this project with you… so?"

A laugh escaped Forrest's lips. Not because what Kyle asked was particularly funny, but more because it was strange to have someone ask if they were friends. Despite it being an awkward question, he was glad that Kyle asked it. He wanted to be friends, and keep talking to him. Plus, he said he didn't care about the kiss. "Yeah, we're friends," Forrest said, "I like hanging out with you--you're really cool." Deep down maybe he was saying he was friends with Kyle because he thought there was still a chance something could happen between them. He hated himself for thinking that, being friends should have just been enough.

"You going to lunch? It's nice out we could eat outside," Forrest said. His regular lunch crew would miss him, but it was getting harder and harder to eat in the lunch room. The smell of food made him want to vomit and stuff it all in his mouth all at once. He hadn't actually eaten anything at lunch since throwing up after eating that stupid fucking pizza. His friends didn't even notice, or if they did they didn't say anything. Plus if they asked he'd just say he had a big breakfast.

Kyle was honestly planning on just ditching the rest of the day to go home, but upon hearing Forrest's suggestion he felt a little better. The idea that Forrest not only wanted to be his friends, like properly not just project partners, but also wanted to hang out with him at that very moment made him genuinely happy. It was a little sad that he was so starved for friends that that was the case, but in that moment, he honestly didn't care.

He wiped any residue of tears from his eyes, he was feeling better now, and if he really thought about it he could twist the presentation around to something good, sure he had messed up, but he had actually done it, that was a very huge step for him. Plus, the project had resulted in him getting to know Forrest and that was good too.

"Yeah, that sounds nice," Kyle said with a small smile on his face, his voice no longer as quiet, "I don't really ever eat in the cafeteria, I usually just bring my own lunch, so," he shrugged a little, if Forrest wanted to go to the cafeteria and get something he'd wait outside for him.

"Nawh I hate their food, it's nasty," Forrest said as he started to walk towards the side doors. He was glad that a smile returned to Kyle's face, he looked so much nicer when he smiled. Forrest lead Kyle outside, it was breezy but warm enough to be comfortable with just a hoodie on. It was quiet, nobody else was outside. They weren't exactly supposed to eat anywhere besides the cafeteria, but nobody said anything to the seniors unless they left school grounds. Forrest headed towards his truck and let his tailgate down so they had a place to sit. 

He opened up his lunch which included some vegetables, a packet of tuna, and a protein bar. He didn't want any of it. Instead, he turned his direction to Kyle, giving him a smile. "It's way nicer to eat out here than in the cafeteria," Forrest said just trying to make some casual conversation. Part of him wanted to bring up the presentation again, and tell him that it was okay he messed up. But, he was pretty sure Kyle didn't want any more attention brought to it. "So like, what do you normally do for lunch?" Forrest asked. He never really noticed what Kyle did before they had to work together. Kyle wasn't even on his radar.

"I usually just hang out in the library, they let me eat there sometimes because they know I don't make a mess, plus I think they think it's sad I don't anything better to do," Kyle said as he started to unpack his lunch, now that they weren't even in the school building anymore he felt comfortable enough to talk normally, and knowing that he and Forrest were friends also made things easier, and it was really nice to just talk and not worry too much for once.

"So I usually just do my homework or any extra studying during lunches and break, so that way I don't really have anything in the afternoons," he explained, laying out the positive aspects with his loneliness and half pretending as if he was alone at lunch voluntarily due to that reason.

He started to unpack his lunch as he spoke, h felt as if it was the complete opposite to Forrest's healthy one, yesterday's dinner's leftover chili con carne between two slices of white bread, two mars bars and a can of Dr Pepper, but in his defence he didn't do any sports and didn't need to stay in shape.

"And when I don't have any homework to do I just text some friends," he felt like it sounded even less sad when he added that and it wasn't like it wasn't true, he did text Amy when he got bored of studying sometimes, "I'm sure you're up too way more fun things though, right? Like you get to see all the crazy action in the cafeteria, I've done think I've been in there more than like twice"

Forrest almost felt bad for Kyle spending all that time alone. Up until this year, he craved lunch hour to have some time to fuck around with his friends and not think about school. It was probably shitty to feel bad about Kyle if that's how he wanted to spend his time then who was he to say. Plus, it was smart to free up his time by doing work during his lunch hours. No wonder why Kyle was getting good grades and Forrest was tanking.

He bit into one of his green peppers, trying not to look at Kyle's lunch. The sight of Dr. Pepper alone made his stomach turn. Jesus, he missed soda. "It's always just full of drama, like last week there was a fight between two freshman girls over some junior who wasn't even interested in them. It's crazy," Forrest said with a shrug. Sometimes it was exciting to watch all the drama play out. Other times it was just exhausting. Everyone was always in other people's business. It was part of the reason Forrest was sure that he didn't want to come out till college.

"I think I'd rather spend lunch hours with you in the library," he said not realizing how it sounded until it came out of his mouth, "not like that--just like as friends. I like the quiet." His face was flushed and he looked away from Kyle. Hoping he didn't realize he still thought he was really cute.

Kyle laughed a little at the description of what the cafeteria was like and while taking a bite of his sandwich he wondered briefly what it would be like to go inside there without feeling like dying because of the pressure that came with being in a room filled with so many people at once. Maybe if he had had friends he would have been able to do it, he went out with Amy, Kim and Adam all the time and they went to places full of people and with them, he could eat in public. He wasn't sure if he wanted to eat in the cafeteria with Forrest though. Not because he hated eating with him, no, sitting with someone during lunch for a change was quite nice, he just knew all of Forrest's friends were in the cafeteria and he'd rather not sit with a bunch of loud jocks. No matter how nice Forrest was he doubted everyone else was just like him.

Then Forrest suggested eating with him in the library, and Kyle liked that idea a lot more than eating with Forrest in the cafeteria. But the blush that appeared on Forrest's face was contagious, it was clear that he had thought it could be taken as something that was more than friendly. Kyle hadn't even thought about that.

"Yeah, the quiet is nice," Kyle agreed without mentioning the reason both of their cheeks were pink, "You're more than welcome to join me, I could help you catch up with the classwork you've missed too if you want?" He opened his can of soda and took a small swig of it, and glanced at Forrest carefully. He didn't feel like it was wrong of him to assume he might be behind in more classes if he was tired enough to sleep true science, but he couldn't really know of course, so hopefully, that didn't upset him.

The blush on Kyle's face made him feel a bit bad, he didn't want to ruin this. Kyle was the first person he had talked to like this in a long time--well besides Letty. Forrest bit his lip nervous that Kyle would deny him. But, he was pleasantly surprised that Kyle not only wanted to eat with him but help him with homework. Most of his lunch hour was sitting in misery anyways, so catching up on classwork would probably be a better way to spend his time. Plus, Kyle was actually pretty smart so it would be easier than trying to catch up by himself. "That sounds great," Forrest said finishing off his veggies but not touching the rest of his food.

The next couple days were relatively normal, well besides meeting Kyle every day for lunch in the library. He told his friends that Kyle was tutoring him since he was falling behind in classes. Which was kinda true. He felt bad unable to admit that Kyle was his friend to them. He wasn't embarrassed about Kyle but embarrassed what his friends would say about it. It was just easier to say Kyle was helping him with homework. Practice was hard and was constantly pushing him to the brink. Coach was constantly praising him on his times which just kept on getting better. Little did he know directly after practice Forrest threw up and almost passed out. As always, the weekend couldn't come quick enough. Again, on Friday his friends invited him out but he already had plans with Kyle.

Forrest couldn't remember whose idea it was to go to the movies, but Forrest was game. For some reason, he was nervous--like first date level nervous. He was supposed to pick Kyle up at 6 pm, but he was ready right after school. He had to have changed his clothes like 5 times before he settled on dark slim fit jeans, a grey v-neck t-shirt, and a red checkered flannel. He messed with his hair until it looked perfectly messy. Soon enough it was time for him to leave and he rushed out the door. It wasn't a date, just two guys hanging out. Forrest thought some of his feelings would have subsided once it was clear they were just friends. But, texting Kyle over the last couple days only made the wanting worse.

In his turquoise rusty truck, Forrest pulled into Kyle's driveway. He shot him a quick text that he was there, and tried not to look too nervous. It was just a movie, that was all.

Kyle actually felt himself become a little happier over the next couple of days and the only addition to his normal routine was Forrest joining him for his library lunches. He was technically tutoring him and making sure he didn't fall to far behind in school, but he was having a lot of fun doing so. He did realise the Forrest wasn't really open about them being friends. And while his anxiety made him worry about him being embarrassed about him or thinking he was weird and not wanting other people to know he associated with him another part of him was just happy he didn't get any extra attention by becoming part of some drama. Because that was how their school were, someone like Forrest wasn't supposed to hang out with someone like Kyle.

But nothing could stop them from hanging out without excuses on the weekends, so they had decided to go watch a movie after school that Friday. Kyle was nervous, he debated back and forth whether he should change when he got home. It wasn't a date or anything, since he had made it clear he didn't see Forrest that way, and the way Kyle saw it Forrest had probably just been curious to see what it would be like that one time, and the point was that if Kyle would be going to a friendly outing with anyone else he wouldn't be fussing this much about his clothes.

In the end, he settled with not changing from his black jeans and dark blue sweatshirt, but he also put on a short-sleeved, white button-up to wear under the sweatshirt. He felt okay with his choice, it wasn't too much but also wasn't nothing.

When Forrest's text came Kyle instantly got excited, he didn't feel the same nervousness he had felt that first day around Forrest anymore, sure he was nervous, but it didn't really feel unpleasant. He grabbed his jean jacket and hurried out before his mother, who was home and very curious about his new friend, could ask any questions.

Kyle didn't hesitate before getting into Forrest's car, which was a sure sign that he was getting comfortable with him, and when he entered he sat down and gave him a bright smile, "hey," he said and started to buckle up his seatbelt, "ready for quality movie going experience?" he asked jokingly, but clearly Kyle loved going to watch a movie on the big screen, it was one of his favourite things ever, and it was fun to have someone other than Amy to do it with.

Now that he was seated there he noticed Forrest had changed from what he had worn during lunch that day, and he looked good. Kyle would never be able to deny that, but he also wouldn't say it out loud unprompted.

"I amped," Forrest said with a laugh as he pulled out of the driveway and headed towards the theatre. Forrest had suggested going to the theater the town over because they had better seats. Really, it was because he didn't want to accidentally see anyone he knew at school. He had a feeling that Kyle knew he was trying to avoid telling his friends that he was friends with Kyle. It made him feel bad but Kyle didn't seem to mind. The drive wasn't long, and was mostly filled with the sounds of Betty grumbling down the road and the radio blaring.

Forrest walked into the theater and bought his ticket to some scary movie Kyle had claimed was supposed to be good. Forrest normally would have chickened out, but he wanted to see it because Kyle had said it was good. Plus, it was just a movie right. He walked through the concessions trying not to inhale the sticky smell of popcorn and soda. He used to love getting a large popcorn and eating the whole thing by himself. He hadn't had popcorn in months.

"This better be good," Forrest said to Kyle, giving him a nervous smile as he headed into the theater. He found two seats near the back center, the best place to sit in Forrest's opinion. The previews had just started which was Forrest's favorite part of the theater. He loved watching the trailers for all the upcoming movies. It just got him super excited. They ended all too soon, and the movie started. The music alone was enough to make Forrest scared. He clenched his fists and started to watch the movie through half closed eyes. This was a bad idea.

When the movies started Kyle couldn't help to notice the fact that Forrest seemed scared, he did remember him saying he didn't like horror movies, but he wasn't sure to what degree that was.

"It's just a movie, you know, nothing will happen," Kyle said and reached out to pat Forrest's shoulder a little, his tone was a little amused, he wasn't making fun of him though, okay maybe a little, but it was in that light-hearted way Kyle tended to act around his friends.

The movie's opening was quite typical, it was setting up the rest of the movie by having some random unrelated character die in the very beginning. She died a very gory death, which told the audience this would be that kind of horror movie. Kyle was excited. He liked the gory once a lot because it was always fun to see how well they managed to do the special effect, and it was always just as fun when they were shitty as when they were good.

He wasn't sure about how Forrest felt about the whole thing and if he was scared, it made him feel a little guilty for forcing him to watch it. Luckily, he had snacks, snacks always made Kyle feel better. Forrest had hurried past the popcorn, and Kyle had been too shy to ask him to buy them for him, with his own money, of course, he just got nervous about ordering the popcorn sometimes. But Kyle had stuffed his pockets with some simple snacks before leaving, so they wouldn't be left without them.

"I know your coach has you on some weird diet, but I brought some snacks if you want," Kyle said and held the Snickers bars out for Forrest in case he wanted it, he also shot him a smile, but he wasn't sure if he would be able to see that in the dark.

This was a lot. He hated how easily scared he was, but knowing Kyle was right there made him feel better. He wanted to reach out and hold his hand, but that would have been weird. This wasn't a date and they weren't like that. But, holding Kyle's hand would have made him feel better. Forrest's attention was pulled away from the gore on the screen when Kyle whispered to him if he wanted any snacks. Snacks, a snickers bar--his favorite candy bar. He whispered thanks and took the candy bar, it would have to be his dinner. 

The candy bar tasted delicious, like the most delicious thing he had ever had. It was a welcome distraction from the gore on the screen. But not enough of a distraction. Of course, a jump scare happened and Forrest jumped in his seat. He reached out and grabbed Kyle's hand. Mostly because he was scared, and that's what he did when he watched scary movies with Letty. His face flushing bright in embarrassment, realizing he was holding Kyle's hand. But--he didn't let go. It didn't mean anything he was just scared, that was all right?


Jan 12, 2018#92

Kyle didn't object when Forrest took his hand, and he kept it in his own the entire movie. It was kind of nice actually, he didn't need it because of the movie like Forrest, but it gave him a sense of comfort he needed because he was out in public.

When the movie was over he made sure to let go of Forrest's hand, he had only been holding it because Forrest had been scared and because he felt a little bad for dragging him into a scary movie. No other reason, and he didn't want to confuse Forrest by letting him thank that either.

"see it wasn't that bad," Kyle said, his tone a little amused, just like when the movie had started, "really, the blood didn't even look that real and you could anticipate the jump scares miles away due to the sound, but it was still pretty—" Kyle stopped mid-sentence because his phone started vibrating in his pocket.

He instantly became nervous, because talking on the phone was one of the worst things he knew, whenever he had to make a phone call about something it usually ended with him not being able to breathe and with his wrists being bloody. But as he checked the caller ID he saw that it was Amy, and he instantly became calmer.

"sorry hang on a second," he told Forrest, and stopped walking, they were still inside, so it was warm and nice and it smelled like popcorn, Kyle loved that smell, "Hey Ames," they exchanged somehow are yous and then Amy proceeded to invite him over, not to hers, but to Adam's because he lived alone. He glanced over at Forrest, he didn't just want to ditch him, and he would in fact rather continue to hang out with him in that moment, but he also had a feeling they'd drive home and say some semi-awkward goodbyes after this… but he didn't want to miss out on those semi-awkward goodbyes either.

"No sorry I'm doing something," "With a friend," "yes I do, fuck you," they went back and forth again, Amy demanded a name and Kyle awkwardly told her, feeling a little embarrassed that he would know he was talking about him. Then Amy had the genius idea to have Kyle bring Forrest over to Adam's. Kyle hesitated but then decided that if Forrest was his friend, it wouldn't be a problem bringing him to meet his other friends, so he pulled the phone away from his ear to indicate that he was talking to Forrest now, "My cousin's inviting us over to our friends place, do you want to come with?"

The hand holding was nice, maybe too nice. He tried to tell himself the entire time that they were just friends and that Kyle was just being nice. That didn't mean that his heart was listening too well. Kyle was right the movie wasn't too scary, probably because he had someone's hand to hold. He was about to agree when Kyle's phone rang. He tried to not listen, that'd be awkward, but when his name was said he couldn't help himself. 

Going to Kyle's cousin's house didn't seem like the worst idea in the world. He'd probably spend the rest of his night sleeping or playing video games. He gave Kyle a bit of a shrug, "yeah sure." Maybe it'd actually be kinda fun. It would be nice to actually hang out with people for once. Even if they were people he hardly knew. Forrest lead Kyle out to his beloved truck and drove over to Amy's with Kyle giving directions of course.

It wasn't far to Kyle's friend's house, and he was finding himself kinda nervous as he pulled into the driveway. What if they hated him? It was a possibility, right? For some reason he found himself wanting Kyle's friends to like him. It was a bit pathetic to be pinning over someone who didn't like him back. Forrest bit his lip nervously as he followed Kyle to the door.

"You sure this is okay?" Forrest asked, almost feeling like he was intruding.

"Yeah, it'll be fine, I promise,"
Kyle instructed Forrest to Adam's apartment complex and they parked outside. He quickly typed in the code to the outer door and led Forrest up the stairs to the first floor where Adam's apartment was located. "Just f-y-I, Amy and Adam are kind of a lot sometimes, and if Kim doesn't talk much it's because she's shy," He knocked twice and stepped inside. Adam's apartment was a little run down and in need of a renovation, it was also messy, but part of that mess was due to Amy and Kim's stuff being sprawled out in the hallway.

"We're here?" Kyle called out gently as he took off his shoes and jacket and motioned for Forrest to do the same.

The moment after uttering the words Amy had popped her head into the hallway. Suspicious look on her face. Her brown eyes widened a little as she noticed Forrest, as if she couldn't believe it was true. Then she hurried up to them as if she hadn't disbelieved her cousin and wrapped him in a big hug, "Hey Kylie," she said in a teasing tone, "I'm sorry I didn't believe you, I didn't realise you were capable of social interaction," what she was saying was technically really mean, but it was the way they talked to each other, and it only got to Kyle on bad days. Today was a good day.

"I realise I have my problems with that but I also have no reason to lie to you, therefore this is proof that you are stupid,"

Amy pulled away from the hug and stepped back to look at Forrest again. She shared Kyle's bright hair colour, though hers was a little more orange-toned, she was pretty average height for a girl, that didn't mean much to Kyle though because most people were shorter than him. She was wearing a simple grey hoodie and calf-length jeans, but under those jeans, she was wearing a pair of brightly coloured rainbow striped socks. She looked Forrest up and down with that look she used when she judged someone and wanted that person to know it. It was a look that appeared on her face often.

"So you're Forrest? I'm Amy" Amy introduced herself bluntly, her hands were in her pockets, so there would be no handshaking it seems, "What are your intentions with my baby cousin?"

"You sound like a dad interrogating your daughter's date!" a guy's voice sounded from inside the apartment.

"Shut up Adam, that entire concept is sexist!" Amy turned to shout in the general direction of the next room. Adam could be heard erupting in a fit of laughter from inside. But Amy wasn't letting them pass her just yet, as she apparently was very much serious about wanting Forrest to state his intentions first, this was apparent by the way she was raising an eyebrow at Forrest, prompting him to answer. Kyle's cheeks were most definitely bright red by now.

Forrest found himself more and more nervous as they entered the apartment. It was a small place and needed some work. Yet, Forrest was intrigued by the idea of someone having a place of their own. It wouldn't be too long before Forrest would have his own apartment at some university---hopefully. It was cool that Kyle new someone who was already living independently. It was somewhere to get away from parents, even if they weren't terrible.

Meeting new people would be fine if it didn't seem that they hated him right away. It made him nervous the way she looked him up an down. Self-conscious about the way he looked, he knew it was ridiculous but he wondered if the snicker's bar made him look as bloated as he felt. He tried to look at her back with judgemental eyes, but instead, he looked nervous. The flush on his face was the bright like Kyle's.

"I uh--I'm just his friend. He's really cool and we talk and stuff and he helps me with homework," his answer was stuttering and awkward. But he didn't expect to be grilled by Amy. Plus, it wasn't like he could tell her the truth. That he thought Kyle was cute as fuck and wanted to kiss his face again. He awkwardly shifted his weight clearly unsure of what to do. Was he even allowed to hang out with them? He looked over at Kyle desperate to be saved. He was right Amy was a lot.

"What do you mean he helps you with his homework he--" Amy was talking s if she hadn't expected anything else from someone as normal looking as Forrest, jocks didn't do math in her book, be she also didn't do math so Kyle didn't know why she was being so judgemental about it. Besides Kyle knew at this point that Forrest was really smart, he picked up on things with ease when Kyle helped him with his homework, he had just fallen behind for some unknown reason and Kyle was glad to be able to help him.

"It means we eat lunch and do our homework together, Ames, chill," Kyle interrupted, because he could see Forrest didn't like her being so… her. He pushed past her which allowed them the enter the combined kitchen living room. Amy followed them cautiously. It wasn't very big but it had a small kitchen area, a couch, two armchairs, a coffee table and a TV, which was all one needed really. There were also a bunch of random objects scattered around the room. Adam's guitar was leaned against a wall and there were dishes in the sink. The controllers to Adam's PS4 were on the floor. It kind of looked what it looked like if a teenage boy got a hold of an apartment. Which wasn't too far from the truth, except for the fact that Adam technically was an adult.

Adam was sprawled out in an armchair when they first entered the room. But the moment they were there he was up on his feet to welcome his guests. He stood at about the same height as Forrest but he was his stark opposite. The Chinese-American man had black, messy hair, a face full of piercings, snake bites, septum, eyebrow stud, the whole thing, the same with his ears. He was dressed in all black, at this moment just a pair black jeans and t-shirt, showing off his tan tattooed arms, but he was the kind of guy to wear huge combat boots and a long black coat with a bunch of studs outdoors, which always made him stand out.

"Oh he's cute," Adam smiled as he made his way over to them. In the background Kim, a cute chubby girl with dark green hair and pale makeup, dressed in black and pastels, peered over curiously but said nothing, "I'm Adam, welcome to my lovely apartment," unlike Amy he held out a hand for Forrest to shake, his nails were painted black, "Sorry for the mess, I didn't expect anyone but these nerds," he gestured to Amy and then Kim, "Plus K, to come over," he grinned over at Kyle for a moment and Kyle responded with a soft smile.

Kyle's friends were an odd assortment. He wasn't sure what he was expecting but it wasn't this. Maybe people more 'regular' looking like Kyle was. At least Adam seemed nice enough. He shook the other's hand and returned his smile, trying hard not to stare at all his piercings. It was a cool look, just not one Forrest was really into. People with that many piercings and who painted their nails black belonged on tv shows and in books, not in real life.

"Nawh, it's cool," Forrest said settling in on a seat on the couch, "it's really cool that you have a place of your own." He was trying to make some sort of conversation to wash the taste of Amy out of his mouth. He tried not to bite his lip too much, which knew made him look young and nervous. He was normally so good at getting along with people, but he didn't know how people like this worked. Probably a silly thing to think, they were just people right. He wanted to be holding Kyle's hand like he was in the movie. 

He looked around the room desperately trying to find something to look at other than Adam's piercings, Kim's green hair, or Amy's judgemental eyes. He settled on Kyle, who was always a sight for sore eyes. "Ya' know, I think you and Letty would be friends," he said to Kyle with a bit of a nervous smile. It was true, Kyle's friends seemed like the people Letty hung out with. Alternative and cooler than all that high school crap. Pretending to be above the drama and the cliques(even if Forrest knew Letty actually wasn't above any of that.

"Yeah, maybe? I dunno, as nice as Letty seems I think I prefer hanging out with you," Kyle said somewhat awkwardly as he went to sit down next to Forrest, as usual not too close, just because he didn't want Forrest to get the wrong idea, which was a little silly since he just had held Forrest's hand for about one and a half hours at the movies. He supposed he didn't want his friends to get the wrong idea.

"Who's Letty?" Amy asked, she had taken her spot in the other armchair and her eyes were still glued to Forrest. Kyle wished she would stop staring at him like that.

"His sister," Kyle informed her, "She's cool,"

Adam went to sit down in the couch now, between Kyle and Kim, who still hadn't said anything, if Kyle was in her position he wouldn't have, either. Unlike Kyle, Adam did not care about how close he was sitting and actually hooked his arm with Kyle's and leaned his head against his shoulder for a moment. Kyle had always loved getting attention from Adam, when he was younger he had been head over heels for him, but since he was three years older nothing had ever happened, and now he was mostly over it. There was still a part of him that really enjoyed it though, the same part of him that might or might not have shared a couple of kisses with him at some point.

Today, though, he felt a little weird about it, something in him was telling him he didn't want Forrest to get the wrong idea about him and Adam either.

"So, you need help with your homework and have a sister?" Adam moved his head from Kyle's shoulder and looked over at Forrest instead, he still kept his arm linked with Kyle's though, "What else about you has stolen our dear K's interest? Do you have any hobbies? And most importantly, are you single?" Adam added that last part somewhat jokingly and somewhat flirtatiously and wiggled his eyebrows a little, all while leaning over Kyle to get a little closer to Forrest.

"Adam," Kyle complained and pushed him away from Forrest. Suddenly Kyle was feeling worried that his friends would be too much and that Forrest would be uncomfortable and start hating him or something. But then again, Forrest had been curious enough to kiss him, maybe he didn't mind being somewhat hit on by a guy, although the idea of Forrest and Adam flirting didn't sit right with Kyle at all.

"I just wanna get to know him," Adam chuckled and leaned back in the couch, "Your friends are my friends,"

He tried not to flush at Kyle's comment about how he'd rather hang out with him. It made him a bit more confident that Kyle maybe actually liked him. Seeing Kyle with a bunch of people that were nothing like Forrest threw him for a loop. He wasn't alternative, or into anything different or cool. He ran and watched bad tv. He didn't even eat junk food. God, he was boring. The worst part was that Amy wouldn't stop looking at him, he wanted to hide from her gaze. It made him feel so uncomfortable, people didn't stare at him--not like that.

He was so focused on Amy's staring he hardly heard Adam. He looked over at Adam who was hanging onto Kyle in a way that made him jealous. A jealousy he didn't even deserve to have. It did make him think that maybe the reason Kyle rejected him was because Adam was his boyfriend. Adam didn't seem like Kyle's type though--not that he knew what Kyle's type was. Even if part of him hoped Kyle's type was him. 

The flirtatious question made him uncomfortable, he had never been hit on by another man. Plus, he wasn't sure how to react--he wasn't sure if they knew he was gay. Kyle said he wouldn't tell anyone, but these people were his friends. His face was flushed brightly as he stared at his feet--this was scarier than the horror movie. "Um. I run. I mean I run for fun, or I guess not for fun but for school. It's fine. And uh--yeah I'm single I'm not really in the market right now," Forrest said lamely. Jesus, he just told him what he did for fun was run. Who the fuck was he? God. He hated himself so much. Normally he was charismatic and people liked him. But between Amy's stare, Adam's flirting, and Kim's silence he was in a group dynamic he didn't understand.

"Aww, too bad, you're cute," Adam complained, focusing on the single and not in the market part rather than the running, "But I guess I have K so I'll live," the last part was a joke and Adam laughed, so did Kim, and Amy shot Adam a temporary glare before moving her eyes back to Forrest.

Adam proceeded to pick up conversation from where he presumably had left when Kyle and Forrest arrived. It was a simple and funny story about some elderly lady down at the convenience store he worked at who had made a fuss about things she thought was on sale just to save every little cent, and then proceeded to ask if she didn't have to pay for the plastic bag as if she hadn't held up the queue for a solid ten minutes. It was a funny story in Kyle's opinion, especially since he knew how much Adam hated his job and how frustrated he must have been in that moment.

All while that was happening Amy had her eyes still placed sternly on Forrest, occasionally looking him up and down. Kyle didn't know everything that was going on in his cousin's head but he knew that part of this all simply had to do with the fact that Forrest wasn't clad in all black, or had piercings or a weird hair colour, and the fact that he ran track. He did sports. To her, he was just some dumb jock.

Kyle couldn't blame her, because whenever he would describe his school to her he would highlight the very present social hierarchy, that he always described having the sports kids in the top. But it still hurt that she didn't even try to trust his ability to make a friend. He tried to ignore her though, and listened along to Adam's stories, hoping Forrest could do the same and that he wouldn't blame him for dragging him along here.
